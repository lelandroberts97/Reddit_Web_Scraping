I recreated this application for Android as his was iOS only and I added some functionality. Instead of changing volume at a certain velocity, you can set two sliders (one for speed in km/h or mi/h and one for volume in %) to control your volume at every velocity for a smooth ride.

This_is_your_mind,0,1579771372.0,eslqfb,"I can't believe I just learned this. I've been snowboarding for over 3 years, I've been in Canada (WBC), Washington (crystal actual mt), Houghton, TC, Beulah (Crystal). 

Just tonight, and nowhere else. I did probably 15 different stretches, just to be ready. Readyness is everything baby, I just learned that (minutes ago) and that's why I suck. Because I'm never ready. I don't do yoga, I don't do stretches, and in 3 years I've barely learned anything. I can sort of 360, but it is awful in form. I'm terrified of big jumps. I don't soar, I pussy out. I want to be safe. 

Well, do you know what's more unsafe than anything? Not being ready to do what you're about to. You might think that because you exercise and do fitness and cardio and lift, you are ready. You aren't. Those muscles have almost nothing to do with snowboard. Your leg muscles help you gain air- they don't tell you anything about what to do in the air. You need to do stretches so you can learn of what is even possible to do while in the air, it is very different than having ground. You need to be able to wyrm like a cat. 

If you don't feel comfortable doing something (I don't feel comfortable going off of jumps) THERE IS A REASON. It's because **you aren't ready to do that.**

This is for all of you. If you're here, you want to be good at snowboarding. Watching good people is awesome and wholesome, and you want it too. You don't just want to be average, you don't want to be okay. Don't take that shit. Be great. You're here for PROGRESS not COMPLACENCY.

That's a message to myself, anyway. Maybe your experience isn't the same, maybe we snowboard for different reasons. But if you clicked on this post, you must've read the title, so let's face it. You're here for the same reason that I am- to be fucking amazing. Leave greatness in the dust, it is beneath you. You will soar, you just need to learn how.

If you want to soar, look up snowboarding stretches. Learn yoga. Learn meditation. You need mastery of your mind, and mastery of your body, to have mastery of snowboarding. There is nothing else, besides duality of mind and the mind that you embody. You need to master both. Mastery isn't a set point that you reach, it is a virtue- it is something you strive for. It is an unattainable ideal. Regardless, you need it if you want to do big shit without getting hurt.

Mastery is not about being here. Mastery is about going there. It is a method, not a static. It is something that you always need in order to progress. Without mastery, there is literally no progress. Think about that. You can't learn switch if you've never learned the opposite. You need to master your regular placement in respect to the mountain to even have an alternative. If you don't have mastery, it isn't riding switch, it's just riding and you don't have a regular way of doing that. Other words, you are lost and doomed.

Mastery is about balance. That's what meditation and yoga are for- balance of the mind, balance of the body.

 In snowboarding, there is no separation. You are constantly fulfilling your mind- what you expect to happen. You need to adopt a few seconds into the future, don't think of what to do but fucking know it. Don't imagine the future, know the future, intuit it. You have that control. If you catch an edge, you will fall- you know that. You know that you will fall before you do, and you know that you will catch an edge before you do- that's what makes you uneasy, which is what makes you catch an edge. The knowledge that you are about to fall. It happens before you fall, every single time. It means you weren't ready to do what you just did. If your adoption of the future includes you failing- you will fail. So, you need to get ready. Starting today, make a plan. Do 10 minutes of stretching before and after you meet the mountain again. You will FEEL the progress. That isn't a guess, I'm certain.

Those of you that are already dedicated, this is groundwork and you may think of me a fool to make such a big deal of it. But, I assure you that more than half the people on the mountain have no idea how to progress, and half of them will probably quit before they realize any of their potential, because they aren't progressing. Some of them will read this, and some of them will gain from it. That's why I'm making this post- I thought the only way to progress was on the mountain. Far from true, much of your progress comes before and after snowboarding.

Anyway, whether it's true or not, all of this came from DMT so imma plug that right here. Can't promise results, but if you go in with intention you can learn *a fucking lot*, ***about anything***, **about everything*****.*** Just wanted to share all of this with all of you, in case some might gain from it. 

Peace and love",Dedication

I started to hoard a big cuantity of videos over the time, so I decided to make a Youtube channel, where I could upload most of them. I decided to call it ""Snowboard Diary"" because, welp, it's kind of a diary where I log every day I've been on the mountain, with every video following a naming pattern of ""Day \# - Ski Resort - Run name"".

Now that I'm starting to see some progress on my riding I decided to start editing my videos with some music and stuff, and I really enjoy watching them from Day 1 onwards, and I was wondering if there's any nerd like me out there, who like watching this kind of stuff.

I don't have any intention of monetizing my channel, so it doesn't really matter if I get lots of suscribers, but I figured that since I'm putting some time into making it look as good as I can, I might as well share it with someone.

afrank33,0,1579601316.0,ernsis,"  

I would love some advice on what to do here.

I recently took a trip to Denver to go snowboarding, went to Loveland and it was great. Upon my return to Phoenix I grabbed my snowboard bag off the carousel and it looked like someone had taken a belt sander to it. My board also got split up one side, and the edge ground down and bent.

I will say, Southwest cut me a check for the value of my bag and some gloves that came out of the bag through the huge rip in it (though not the snowboard). I should add the flight had been delayed multiple times and changed gates before we finally departed from Denver. Collecting my luggage in Phoenix happened in the early morning hours of Monday, January 13th. I had to be at work in a few hours so I went home got ready for work and napped on the couch for a few minutes. After getting home from work I started unpacking my stuff only to find the belt sander had done damage to my snowboard as well.

I called Southwest to report the newly found damage only to get the runaround, and to be told I would be receiving an email from ""central baggage"" with more information. I waited 48 hours and no email appeared. I called back. This time I was told to upload documents and pictures via a web portal, which I did. I called back the next day and was told they had no record of me uploading any documents. Alas, I attempted a second upload, but this time decided to tweet @/SouthwestAir and see if it got a better response.

[https://twitter.com/andrewf63904166/status/1218659278363324416](https://twitter.com/andrewf63904166/status/1218659278363324416)

In summary, since I did not report the damage to the board within 4 hours, I was out of luck, according to their policy. They have offered me a $150 voucher to Southwest, but I really want them to pay to fix/repair my board.

I would really appreciate any advice for dealing with Southwest, or fixing my board.

I wanted to share my experience with our first indoor snow park, it didnt go too well. I flew out to NYC for some work in the area, and I came a day early to visit Big Snow.  

I bought a pass+rental, put in my preferences (snowboard, height, weight, shoe-size) etc,.  I thought on a Sunday Night (but it is MLK tomorrow) it might not be too busy. It was busy (my first time so I dont know). 

The experience of checking in from the staff is all a bit vague and unclear of what to do where to go.  I didnt mind some of the attitudes, but I wasnt sure if I kept screwing up or what because I seemed to be in the wrong place every-time. 

Wait in line for your ticket time, wait in line for a safety video, wait in line for clothing, boots, all of it I totally get. But it being unclear on where to go, was a bummer.  All of the staff seemed flustered with the guest volume.

Once I got to the boot fitting area, I find out that they ran out of mens 10 to 12 boot sizes; the guy there said you will have to wait for boots to come back. 

By that point I gave up, and walked to the desk and got a refund. Honestly I'm a bit impatient when it comes to standing around in lines. They gave me a coupon for a free ticket but I may not be back here for a few months.

If I brought all of my gear, I would have avoided all of this. It looked like people were sneaking past the gondola video area if they had gear, and they also pulled people out of line because they had gear.

Im excited for what big snow could do for the sport, and bring new people to snowboarding who havent had a chance. So I hope it does well.

DominikSublime,0,1579489338.0,er0ja5,"Hey here to give some output on these mountains for ppl deciding to take future trips.

1st January and february have cold punches (polar vortex) so double check with your crew. We were well prepped. But -30 gave a cold zip on groomers.

2nd check each mountain condition and visibility. Some get more snow. Some get more sun. Have a gameplan earlier, then double check in morning use snow-forecast.com

3rd Canmore vs Banff stay; Canmore better bang for buck kitchens etc. In lodges, also I think there is a shuttle from Canmore to Banff so double check. Rental car needed here and more versatile in choosing mountain.
Banff is closer to the hills and shuttles all over so if your comfortable with a little better and easier lifestyle go that route. More $$$ there too.

4. know what kind of rider you are and what kind of group your with. Banff sunshine is awesome for bigger groups and families once you reach the main village. As all those lifts funnel back to the main one. (goats eye lift seperate from more extreme riding)

Lake Louise little more adventurous but back bowls have long funnel back to the lift. Better to keep under 4 man team.

Kicking horse - (more advanced riding) not in the ski big 3 package but a favorite amongst locals for more extreme riding and a great layout for bowls to runs to tree runs. And back to the Gondala. So super cool for small groups to meet back at the bottom no matter the run. 

All in all cool trip, each mountain had its own terrain. Best snow was in kicking for me, most open terrain was Banff, most transfer runs lake Louise.

K2 atlas 153cm 2011 snowboard, with some bs bindings. Board is good but I upgraded. Bought it from a rental shop so the bindings suck but it‚Äôs great to learn. Will come with 9.5 boots which not gonna like kinda suck.

NOW IPO bindings: I have buyers remorse and I‚Äôll lose a good chuck of change trying to return them. I bought em and now plan on buying stepons

Burton flannel jacket size medium but runs big so could be a large.

If anyone in the NYC area can help me find a place to sell or hell donate it‚Äôs be highly appreciated. Or if anyone wants to buy it from me.

Please help hahaha",Need to sell lift tickets VT

GodBorn,0,1578700524.0,emstpu,"It‚Äôs a really odd and long story, I hope it‚Äôs not confusing

I‚Äôm very new to the sport and this guy came up to me and asked to race down the mountain. I lost pretty hard but we took the lift back up together. 

On this lift he talked about his board non stop, eventually convincing me to try it. It was a extremely fun and stable board compared to mine, I was able to do a lot of things that would get me in trouble on my board. 

Eventually he showed me a secret pow spot, and had me ride his board down it.  

All this was great and all, but it just seemed odd.  I barely met this guy and he was willing to let me try his board and show me a untouched pow spot? He asked me to show him my pass, and asked if I was born and raised in Colorado which just seemed way odd. 

This last thing he told me was that his board was going to be sold out soon, and if I wanted his board with that graphic I should buy it soon as possible. 


Honestly I am down with buying the board if it‚Äôs true, the board was really fun, and I like the graphic as-well. Though normally I would I wait for a sale or something, but I willing to purchase it now if that‚Äôs the case. 

It was just a really odd event to me. Most time people aren‚Äôt that nice or welcoming. Was he trying to sell me the board or something else? I‚Äôm just confused to be honest. 

The board was a Orca Lib. 


Tldr. Guy showed me a pow spot and let me use his board, and told me I should buy it before it‚Äôs to late. Felt extremely odd.


Edit: All right boys, I waited to long, this morning the store near my work had a 153, 156, and 159. I‚Äôm getting off work right now and my store only has the Orca case bag left.

I haven‚Äôt asked friends who don‚Äôt know how because they usually don‚Äôt have snow pants/jackets/gloves etc. 

I enjoy going by myself. It‚Äôs less hassle and wastes much less time waiting for people.  I can also focus on riding and improving . Still though, It‚Äôd be nice if I can find friends with intermediate/advanced skills that I can shred with so we can learn and help each other along the way.","Look for snowboarding friends in Manhattan, NY"

I always improve the fastest when I‚Äôm doing things that scare me. For example, I had been spending a lot of time in the park hitting the same jumps over and over trying to dial in my takeoffs and landings. I was making progress, but the progress was slow. After staring to get bored, I decided in a burst of courage that I would try the much larger jumps to the side. I managed an ok landing after flailing through the air and decided to go back to the small jumps some more. To my surprise I was suddenly vastly more confident, able to keep more speed going off the lip, and stick the landings. Same thing happened when I started riding switch. The steeper runs where I was more scared had me improving much faster. 
To summarize:  Do things that scare you. You‚Äôll get better, more confident, and probably have more fun too.

Fated_to_Die,0,1578208923.0,ek4bdj,"The mountain is face as fuck. It is tall as fuck. That's how we've defined it. That's the difference between a mountain and a hill, a hill is pretty fucking tall but a mountain is tall as fuck. It's wrong, it shouldn't be tall. There is no reason for tall on a sphere. It should be fixed. That's why we have snowboarding, to fix the tallness. We push snow to the bottom to fix it, to make it not tall (cause remember there's no reason for tall on a sphere, it is wrong). When we're all done, there will be no mountain, just feet of snow. A lot of feet of snow, it will be smooth though. Great for shredding. If you could just find a place to fall from. Like a mountain. Well shit. You need the mountain to board. Without the mountain, there is no fall, there is no shredding. This is what we mean when we say the mountain will fall. Of course it will, that's all it does, is fall. The mountain falls, because we are the mountain and we fall from the mountain. That's all anything does, is fall. That's what gravity says we do, and gravity is just a term that we made up to say ""this happens"". Falling happens, always. We can't get around that, because we created gravity like 20 years ago and now we're all trying to fix it but the more we try to fix it, the worse it gets. we learned that fixing things is actually fun so now we keep breaking it just so that we can keep on fixing it. and now we have snowboarding. frickin cool. I love emergence.

&#x200B;

So basically, by snowboarding, we are pushing snow to the bottom of a mountain, to fix the mountain, to make it no longer tall as fuck, but just fuck because it isn't tall anymore. And without the tallness you can't shred. Anyway, what I'm saying is we're doing God's work, we're making the mountain fall on itself. I mean, where else would it fall? Off the mountain? The base is just as much mountain as the summit is. All there is, is mountain. Even dips and valleys, are just inverted mountains. The earth? Just a sphereical mountain. You can confirm this by thinking about where a mountain ends. Where does it end? The smoothness at the bottom? Well, what is the bottom? It's not the surface level, I'll tell you that much. It's below the surface, wherever rocks form- because a mountain is just a huge (read: tall as fuck) rock covered in snow.

&#x200B;

So what I'm really saying is, there is no wisdom of the mountain, because mountains are freakin stupid and that makes snowboarding stupid. that's why it's fun, because it's stupid. it absolutely does not make you athletic, there's a huge risk of injury, and the only thing you get out of it is fun. that's why it's stupid, because it's fun. nothing that is fun, isn't stupid. get that? why is drinking fun? because it's fucking stupid, it's just poisoning your body on a small scale. why is dancing fun? because it's fucking stupid and pointless. if you make it exercise, then it isn't fun, it's just work. that is the separation in life, there is work and there is fun. work is smart, because it allows you to have fun. you can't have fun if you didn't eat and now you're dead. right?

&#x200B;

if you made it all the way through, god bless you you stupid fuck. you're as dumb as I am. enjoy the mountain. do lots of drugs. never stop having fun, or you might as well die because the only thing left is work and who the fuck wants to work without ever having fun. you need both for a healthy balanced breakfast, choose kellogs. sorry for being so harsh, truly, I love you all.

WallLearner,0,1578008868.0,eizu8e,"I've been around reddit long enough to know that this will get downvoted to Bolivia, but I've got to put it out there anyway: **beginner lessons are holding back snowboarding**. I think this is the main reason why there are fewer people snowboarding today than there were back before the sport was mainstream. 

I learned to ride in the mid-90's, and although people have said snowboard lessons were a thing back then, I wasn't aware of them and no one I rode with back in the 90's had ever taken a lesson. Basically you had a bunch of skateboarders and ex-skiers who took a board up onto the hill and after the first day they either gave up or learned to link turns comfortably. Sink or swim.

Fast foward 25 years, and I'm teaching my nephew how to ski (I told him when he can make parallel turns on blue trails he can switch). I was shocked at what I saw from the snowboarders at the magic carpet.

 * One young couple was teaching their son to ride. He was about 3 and on a board with a leash. His parents never attempted to teach him edging or speed control. The dad held the leash tight to control his speed and the mom would spread her legs and say ""knuckle dragger!"" and he would crouch down and go between her legs. I was thinking ""God bless those two, they have a million times the patience I do. Are they really going to give up 5+ years of their prime riding years playing pointless games with their son?"" But after an hour they disappeared. Perhaps they handed their kid off to a grandparent.

 * A woman was teaching her boyfriend to ride by holding his hands as he attempted to turn. He caught a bunch of toeside edges and ultimately ski patrol had to take him down the mountain in a stretcher. I think he broke an ankle.

 * Another kid was being taught and basically making falling leaf turns on his heelside edge. I never saw him on his toeside edge.

 * One older snowboard instructor was teaching a young man and he was slowly making progress with gentle linked toe and heelside edges. Still, I was struck by the fact that it's like learning to ride a bike while going at a walking pace. It's just hard without a bit more speed and momentum to flex your board.

 * Meanwhile the skiers were generally progressing in a more or less linear fashion doing pizza and french fries. 

Many older generation snowboarders have since taught our kids skiing, with the possibility of switching as they get older. We learned to ride as teenagers with adult-level coordination, strength and confidence. We collectively realized that learning to ride as a kid is very difficult except for exceptional athletes.

So here are my conclusions:

 * Even the ski community is unreasonably enthusiastic about lessons. Level 3 Ski instructors are not like tennis or golf pros who can generally wipe the floor with the club champion, and have taken extensive certification courses in teaching. And keep in mind that most instructors that teach beginners are not even level 1 certified. 

 * About 90% of the population aged 5 to 65 can learn to ski, but snowboarding is harder to learn and the percentage is lower. People may have given up in the 90's because they fell a lot, but people today are quitting in higher numbers because they aren't getting any positive sense of progress at all. They spend an hour or two on the bunny slope and watch the beginning skiers make steady progress. I think this probably the most important point. **Snowboard lessons are based on the not-so-Noble Lie that virtually everyone can learn to snowboard if they follow a gentle enough progression. But instead this gentle progression is useless for people who are not athletic enough to snowboard, and frustrating for people who are.** I'm sure there are people who through sheer determination and force of will stuck with it and became good riders despite not being good athletes, but they are as exceptional in their own way as the good athletes who pick up snowboarding easily.

 * Snowboarders don't have pizza and french fries. They have to go immediately to linking parallel turns, and that requires balancing on a single edge. **Much like riding a bike, you are more stable with at least a little speed because changes in edge pressure are used to center your balance. At lower speeds those changes are smaller and slower to develop** so it takes better balance to ride at slow speeds than moderate speeds. Moreover, linking turns benefits from flexing the board, and even if beginner boards are flexed for magic carpets (and I doubt they are), a board that soft won't provide much energy. Snowboarders need a steeper bunny slope than skiers to make good progress.",Snowboard lessons are holding back the sport

For example, my next goal is to master presses and butters, then take on some beginner features like small jumps, boxes, and rails. I would like to keep the board for at least 2 seasons. 

I am currently riding the Burton Indie 155 that I bought off of letgo. Although I‚Äôve come to love the board it is not what I need in terms of riding style. The board is very stiff and doesn‚Äôt offer a lot of pop at all.

Sladeix,0,1578012620.0,ej7fkm,"I‚Äôve narrowed down my decision to two boards either the Capita DOA or the Capita Ultrafear. I‚Äôve heard amazing things about both boards but can‚Äôt decide. 


The DOA is just so amazing at everything however do to its stiffer flex and zero camber it makes the board less playful which kinda sucks yet from this it allows the board to be a great all mountain board too which is nice because my family doesn‚Äôt go into the park often and i would like to ride with them, finally the board is built for bigger jumps yet i don‚Äôt see myself going off the big jumps very often i lean more towards medium to small plus some jibs but that might change.


Then there is the Ultrafear which is a very playful board and even though the Capita gives it the same flex as the DOA almost everyone says it‚Äôs super soft furthermore its been rated as one of the best park boards this season. It‚Äôs great for jibbing and getting playful and not sure about this but i think it‚Äôs also pretty good at jumps but not so much on the big jumps. Then there is the issue of it not being all mountain which limits the time i get to spend skiing with my family and friends however i could keep my current board which is a all mountain/park board but the hassle would be switching the boards out during the day.

I ride mainly on the east coast so there is not much powder, especially towards the end of the season when I do a lot of riding. I am fairly experienced and split my time fairly between the park (mainly hitting boxes, rails, jumps) and also  carving and bombing blacks. My friend group is fairly split on what they enjoy so I'm pretty much all over the mountain all day but mainly enjoy the parks.

Im currently looking at Bataleon Boards, specifically the Whatever and the Disaster. (Don't really like the design on the evil twin) I currently ride a medium flex Burton board (Camber) and enjoy it a lot but I feel like it is slightly more stiff than I desire.I struggle to hold butters extremely well and am hoping to find something a little more playful which is why I slightly desire a softer flex. However, I am worried a softer board such as the Disaster and others will result in significant decrease in my stability on jumps as well as riding at high speeds and holding my edge while carving blacks. Then again with how light I am I wonder if a wider but softer board will provide the best of both worlds. What are your board suggestions and advice.

GridyGrod,0,1546901087.0,adnabm,"I have just moved (to the bay area) and I am looking for a new snowboard. I have brought my boots with me, but left the snowboard behind.
Some info about me:
- I'm beginner/intermediate (do mostly green and blue hills)
- I am not interested in progressing into park riding
- I am interested in progressing to more powder riding
- My current board is the gnu carbon credit
- Height: 179cm Weight: 170lb
- My budget is $600

I bought my first board mostly on the recommendation of the shop owner, and didn't do much research, so I wanted to do some this time around. I was taking a look at some of the never summer boards based on other recommendations, but not too sure which would be okay for me. The proto 2 gets thrown around a lot, but that seems its more suitable for advanced riders? Saw some recommendations for the Never Summer Warlock, and some lib tech boards as well. Any suggestions would be appreciated!

Newbie when it comes to googles. I have a product in my mind that provides 4 choices. Black(17% VTL),Gold(20%), blue(20%) and silver(18%)

I read what the meaning of VTL is, but the question is this. If I can afford to buy just one google, which one shoul I choose, considering I am expecting to have sunny days and also cloudy days on the mountain (Always day though).

Durkintr,0,1544140199.0,a3ty3l,"Hey all -

Just bought a ""new"" 2010 Burton dominant on eBay to replace my old Dom that got destroyed when I was in a bad car accident.  The 2010 Dom has a channel system, and from what I have been reading, it's a different channel system than that now deployed on newer Burton boards (the channel is now wider/narrower, I guess?).  I know I need bindings that are compatible with the m5 channel system vs the m6 system now used on newer Burtons.  This brings me to my question:

I am having a hard time finding definitive answers on which bindings available today will be compatible with that m5 channel on the 2010 Burton Dominant.  Can anyone give me any pointers?  Will any Flow bindings work?  Will m5 conversion kits make all of this moot and allow me to fasten pretty much any binding to my ""new"" board (as long as the disk is compatible)?  Thanks in advance for any advice you're able to give me!",Proper Bindings for 2010 Burton Dominant

kidcharm86,0,1536625826.0,9esovt,"Hey everyone.  I'm trying to ID an old Burton board that I had.  I bought this board used in the mid-to-late 90s.  It was an asymmetrical slalom board.  IIRC, it was a plain gloss black on top and had a white base with ""BURTON"" in red block letters.

I brought this board out to Breckenridge with me when I moved out there in 2000.  I rode it a bit but never mastered it, it was a wicked board!  I left it with my buddy when I moved back to Minnesota a few years later.  He kept it as a decoration this whole time, it was recently displayed on his front porch 2 blocks off of Main Street.  He just called the other day and said it was stolen off the porch during Octoberfest!

Neither one of us remember a model name or any other identifying info on it.  Any info, especially pics, would be greatly appreciated!  And if you're out in Summit County and spot a 30 year old asym, let me know, that's my board!!",Attention Burton historians!
