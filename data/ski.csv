euq1wg,Just got back from Stomp It Tutorials freestyle camp; here's my perspective,"The past few years I had been watching /u/StompItTutorials videos on YouTube. The tricks and the energy really got me stoked and wanting to try stuff. Last season I started hitting some (for me) bigger jumps at Whiteface in their park and it was a ton of fun.

I then took a freestyle private lesson at my [local hill] (https://catamountski.com/) and started practicing 180s and switch.  I really was not very good or successful but it was fun and gave me the basics to practice with.

Just to give you a little context, [I’m 40] (https://imgur.com/0exL2Fy) and took about an 18 year break from skiing. I’ve been back into it the past couple seasons and cant get enough. My daily drivers are Nordica Enforcer 100s and can ski pretty much any trail on the hills on the /r/icecoast.

At the start of this season [Jens] (/u/StompItTutorials) put up 4 camps and I signed up almost immediately. When I was looking at these camps previously, there was not much info on them so I thought this might help others who are potentially interested.

I just got back Saturday the 25th from the camp.

**With the price of the camp you get:**

* 6 nights at Hotel Vorab in Flims (part of the LAAX ski area)
* Breakfast and Dinner included
* 5 day ski pass
* 5 days of coaching ([10 total participants with 2 coaches] (https://imgur.com/dvQbaG1))
* Video analysis of your day every evening
* 3 nights of trampoline workshop

**What you need to provide:**

* Travel to and from the hotel
* Your clothes
* Ski gear if you don’t want or need to rent (I rented and was given a brand new pair of Poachers)

**Here’s my take:**

* The accommodations are great. The Hotel Vorab is spotlessly clean; I mean impeccable. It has a ski room with boot dryers/heaters so you don’t need to bring yours. 
One thing to note; you will be expected to pay for tap water at dinner table service. It seems to be normal in Switzerland. The food was great.
* You will bunk with someone. Be prepared for that and bring earplugs. My roommate and I shared the same temperature preference so had no issues sleeping. I know this was not the same with everyone.
* Breakfast is great; it's a huge buffet with all the protein and carbs you could want.
* The lunch spots on the hill are [beautiful] (https://imgur.com/V2E5DIl). We were lucky with 5 [bluebird] (https://imgur.com/FzCjY9n) [days] (https://imgur.com/UScAooL), even with the Sahara dust causing a slight orange tint and haze the last 2.
* The majority of us were > 40 years old. This surprised me and I was expecting to be one of the oldest. 
We represented the following countries:
Australia, New Zealand, United States x 3, England, Greece, Spain, Italy, Netherlands
* [Jens](/u/StompItTutorials) suggests this camp is for anyone who can ski parallel. While technically that’s true, I know many parallel skiers who would be extremely challenged or intimidated by some of the slopes we hit hard. You should be comfortable carving well on any slopes including double blacks, and ideally enjoy charging hard and fast.
* So many of the tricks are predicated on proper ski form and technique, there is an emphasis on those and plenty of work done to make sure you’re working on it. I noticed a significant increase in my ski position awareness and my ability to carve well due to this.  **E.g. one foot skiing was something we did a bunch of and it really helps.**
* I think all of us made it from either never or [poorly hitting 180s] (https://imgur.com/8SeQqhw) to solidly hitting 180s on jumps and half of us hitting our first 360s.  A couple people got comfortable at and repeatedly hit multiple 360s. 
* Boxes hurt when you fall on them. Some people had crash pads; I wish I did.  By Friday my right hip was noticeably swollen and sore compared to my left.
* The pop is one of the most important things to nail correctly. Practice it now.
* The video analysis is a hugely valuable part of this camp. Breaking down your moves and showing what needs to change or what can improve was really helpful. A trick which seemed to go well on the slope could have a bunch of small things which were not correct.
* Those proline jumps are legit huge (no we did not get close to hitting them).  We skied over the knuckle and rollers and holy shit it makes you pucker up. One class member didn't realize you had to take it slow and had an unintentional 40 ft drop which he landed.
* We worked on pops, jumps, boxes, grinds, half pipe, [switch, 180s](https://youtu.be/pYRChbdy3HQ), 270s, 360s, grabs, and probably a few other things I neglected to mention.
* Jens and his co-coach Will are both great coaches and really genuine people. Every time someone hit something well or new you could hear them exclaim ""fuck yea!"". Also, when we were doing something incorrect, they would call out out.

Overall it was an amazingly rewarding time. It was so much fun to be with a group of people all working hard to learn and accomplish new things who could ski well in the first place. I rarely get to spend that kind of time with others these days.

eu2ug6,LPT: always wear a helmet!,"When I took up skiing again a couple years ago after having not skied since I was in middle School I decided to add a helmet to my ski outfit. Yesterday, I was reminded why they're so important.

I was skiing a hill in Northern Hokkaido called Nayoro Piyashiri. It has some of the best snow in the entire region, not always the biggest snow falls but it's fluffy and deep, even in a bad season like this one. Yesterday it was snowing all day, and it had been snowing the night before, and most skiers stay off all but the easiest to access runs. My friend and I discovered one of the side runs was mostly untouched and full of knee-deep powder and completely ungroomed. After skiing some of the most beautiful on-piste terrain I've ever experienced we had to cross over from one run to the other where the powder got waist-deep. As I was making a turn, my skis crossed, and I fell hard. When I hit, my head connected with something frozen underneath the powder. Hard. It was really bad, I had to dig myself out and sit down and recover for a while. At that moment I was so grateful for my helmet. Even today my neck is extremely stiff from the hit I took. But because I was wearing a helmet I was able to continue skiing for the rest of the day and enjoy my day instead of getting a ride home in an ambulance.

I wasn't skiing in particularly difficult terrain, it was conditions I should have been able to contend with. This is a reminder that it doesn't matter what you're skiing on, no matter how good you are, it only takes a slight misstep and you could be looking at a traumatic brain injury. Don't take risks with your brain guys, good helmets are way cheaper than medical bills or a lifetime of brain damage. Ski safe!",1580046251.0,RekrabGrimm,1

I’m looking to get a solid pair of all mountain skis, and so far the ones that I’ve had my eye on the most have been Salomon QST 99’s and the Blizzard Rustlers 10. I’ve demoed the QST 106’s and those were fun but maybe thinking those are a little too wide on the underfoot. I’ve also demoed Icelandic Nomad 105’s (really enjoyed those as well but didn’t feel stable when I was bombing a run), Atomic Chetler 100’s (enjoyed those! Liked how it was easier to initiate turns on those but didn’t feel like they did the greatest in powder) and then atomic vantage 97’s (did not like these, wasn’t sure if they were too heavy or not enough rocker but struggled to make turns on them).

es6wn6,Need advice on what level ski's to rent,"I'm hoping someone could steer me in the right direction on what ski's I should rent. 

I do an annual trip with some friends to Utah every year. I would consider myself an average skier. After a few warm up runs, I usually get bored of blue's and work my way to blacks. We do go off course on occasion. Not much more than that. 

I know absolutely nothing about ski gear however. Usually, I just walk into a ski shop, tell them my situation and ask them what they recommend to rent, and it's always the ""performance"" package.

Is this the right move for me? For reference, there are 3 levels; Sport, Performance and Demo (not sure if other ski shops have different names for their levels). Would it be worthwhile to dish out the extra $12 per day for the demo package? Would I notice a difference? I'm 6'2 220 (again, no idea if that matters).

I've always rented equipment at the resort, but the last teacher I had recommended I get my own gear at this point since he thinks I'm past the beginner point and the rental gear might limit me. So here I am, I've always relied on whatever the rental shop had so I don't know much about skis and looking for some feedback. My current level: I can go down on blues, I can carve and have no issues linking turns.  Blacks are still a no-no and when I say I can go on blues, that's when they are not too icy. I live in NYC area and I mostly plan on skiing in east coast resorts that tend to have icy conditions. If I can find a ski that can handle east coast icy conditions, some light offtrail that I might want to add in the future and the occasional trip to the west coast that would be great.

es7d5w,"first day of skiing: tips, notes","Its my first post here about the my first day of skiing. I did in tahoe yesterday. Only my thoughts, may not be correct. Thanks.

Skiing is an expensive hobby, relatively. Few things making it so:

1. lift tickets, lift (obviously) lifts you to higher altitude so that you can ski back to base. (100$/day)
2. Need to rent it otherwise you cant ski. ski boots, ski, poles : 60$/day
3. ski clothes. base thermals(20$), down jacket insulation(50$), waterproof exterior(50$), gloves, woollen hat, neck gaiter, merino wool socks, snow boots, snow goggles. (150$ one time)
4. travelling to ski resort, from home. It involves staying in a hotel, eating etc. (130$/day)
5. if you are going with family, their ski expenses as well, add to it. (xNumFamily)

Few optimizations to above expenses:

1. buy in off-season/as early as possible. Go to skiing resort early if you intend on spending whole day there. Everything takes time: reaching skiing resort, parking, getting lift ticket, getting skiing equipment.
2. find a place to rent it cheap somewhere. IT is bloody expensive that renting equipment costs as much as 60% of the lift ticket.
3. better to buy if you are going to frequent skiing (at least few basic necessities such as base thermals, socks etc). Else find a friend who can loan you for the weekend, if he isnt going on the same day :)
4. like any other travel accomodation, if max time is going to be spent on skiing, may not spend as much on hotel. Eat at a value restaurant (like chipotle ?)
5. spouse couldnt ski. She is a newbie and has bit of weight issue. dont take lift tickets for them. Buy on demand, if needed. She mostly helped kid with the skiing.

Notes:

* preparing for Skiing: talk to friends, watch youtube videos. unfortunately, nothing can prepare you for actual experience
* before putting on skiing equipment, eat food/hydrate/freshen up etc. its bloody tedious to unpack yourself and repack. given the clothing layers, skiing equipment etc.
* skiing is essentially, leverage your weight, gravity and your center of mass to push yourself (ski). breaking speed by snow plow(ing). sense of balance is v.v. essential.
* if you are speeding up, do SNOW PLOW.
* if its your first day

        + choose a `green` slope (easiest level).
        + forget about turns, simply ski down
        + you WILL fall down. It is essential to get up. Make sure you are prepared for it, as much as you can. I fell down 15 times, during first two lifts.
        + wasnt able to walk on skiis, it is required to board the lift.
        + wasnt able to get off the lifts, always crash landed on the slope.
        + ensure you hold poles correctly, by putting pole grip roundabouts in your wrist. so that whenever you fall down, the poles ll stay with you.
        + learn how to put on skiis and get off it. ensure skiis are put against the slope and you put on the downward ski first. use the poles to hold you steady before you put on your second ski.
        + getting off skis: reach a place where skis are against the slope, use poles to push the heel lock back, to unlock ski boots.
        + dont try to push skiis to the direction you want. try to leverage gravity and snow plow to push you into correct direction.
* you might have better control on one leg (right/left handed). That makes difficult to control speed/direction via the weaker leg.",1579699129.0,geekasm,1

es3kl0,Big Sky Run Suggestions,"*^(I posted this in the megathread and after more than a day it didn't receive any replies and was buried so I'm posting it here.)*

I'm off to Big Sky next week, first time there. I'll have 3 full days of skiing and was looking for run recommendations. I'm used to skiing the Canadian Rockies and spoke with a friend who has skied both resorts across Canada as well as Big Sky and says that Big Sky inflates their run ratings +1 versus what things are in Canada. Basically, he says a green run here is a blue at Big Sky, a blue run here is a black at Big Sky, a black here is a double black at Big Sky, a double black here is a triple black at Big Sky. Greens at Big Sky would be like kiddie slopes/learning areas here. Is this true?

For starters, I doubt I'll be doing anything off Headwaters. I've heard it's great but also very rocky + cliffs. Not really my cup of tea. I'm fine with very steep runs, but prefer open bowls with room to turn over chutes, plus I don't really want to do the hike. Here in Canada I'm comfortable on any black and all but the very hardest double blacks.

I have a few questions about runs and would love suggestions for any of your favs/hidden gems. Also any specific tips accounting for current snow conditions (late January) would be great!

**South Side:**

Looking at photos, Hanging Valley off the back of Lone Peak looks like an awesome run, is it? Lenin and Marx are both musts, is the snow good on them right now? Is Bavarian Forest a good run? The trees don't look too dense.

Also, though I won't do Headwaters, I would consider the Gullies Traverse & Gullies 1/2/3 off Lone Peak. Are they easier/less sketchy than Headwaters?

**Front Side:**

What are the best blue/blacks off Swift Current/Ramcharger/Thunder Wolf. I expect we would probably spend the first day just exploring that part of the mountain without heading up Lone Peak. Any favs/suggestions?

The long blacks/blues off Six Shooter & Lone Tree look fine, but they seem really out of the way and a long lift back up to ski them. Are they worth it or should I skip?

Finally, is it worth hiring a guide for a half day to ski Big Couloir and North Summit Snowfield? I don't have any gear & def wouldn't ski them on my own, but after checking out videos/photos I think I would be comfortable skiing them with a guide.

ermek5,Friendly reminder to wear AND BUCKLE/FASTEN your helmet.," This is just a friendly reminder and PSA to wear a helmet and also buckle/fasten it and to remember that falls happen when you least expect it.

I was skiing bowls and steeps and trees and bumps all day. On my way out I stopped by a hut for a drink of water and a bathroom stop. I took my helmet off inside and when I went back out I put the helmet on but didn't buckle it. My day was done and I was skiing a chill blue groomer to the main area of the resort to catch a bus home so I was being casual. I was skiing chill and in control and I just caught some dumb edge and smacked into the hardpack and my helmet flung off. It still took the impact for me so that's good but it could have been much more painful. Thankfully (and super embarrassingly) I fell right by some patrollers standing by a slow sign. They grabbed the helmet and helped me laugh it off: ""i'd be lying if I said that hasn't happened to me"" one of them said.
Thankfully it was my last run of the day and it did nothing to impact the ski day for me.

It's just a reminder to be focused all the time. Falls happen when you least expect so wear a helmet and make sure it stays on your head! If I hadn't had a helmet a silly fall from me not paying attention could have been concussion city.

I have read Banff Springs has an outdoor pool and ski storage spot but CLL is closer to the best mountain (?) in Lake Louise ski resort and has an awesome view.

Probably going to do a full day at LL, full day at Banff Sunshine and a half day at Norquay

epv7ob,Cross Country Skiing for work,"Hey y'all,

I'm looking at getting a pair of xcountry skis for work. I do forestry work in the upper Midwest and am currently working on a very large area chock full of logging trails that are always open and clear. Think ungroomed snowmobile trails. I don't have a snowmobile or a way to transport one so I figured skis would be the next best option. 

Currently I've found that Nordic touring skis are the best bet for me as I would be on mainly ungroomed trails.

I'm debating between metal edged vs non. If I could get positives and negatives of each that would be great  I'm also trying to find a good boot.

My preference for boots would be to have one pair I could wear all day, skiing to my plots deep in the woods and walking around on the plots. These plots can be in wet areas like swamps and I can still bust through the ice, so I'm looking at something with a higher top, mid calf to knee high like muck boots. Waterproof and insulated as well. That way I don't have to drag more gear than necessary into the woods. Any ideas?

Any information would be appreciated! I have little experience in this field and I don't know what I don't know. So if you have questions for me please ask :)",1579263109.0,YarrowBeSorrel,1
epyagr,Wide open groomers of the west vs thin woody groomers of the east,"The type of terrain I am talking about:

* open, above tree-line (West coast mountains in the rockies seem to have a lot less trees as well, even below the tree-line.) https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/lastshot-svs-112818-2-1.jpg
* thin trails inside the treeline https://www.switchbacktravel.com/sites/default/files/Skiing%20East%20Coast%20%28m%29.jpg

My perspective: I grew up on the east coast and have only skied east coast. The closest i've come to west coast skiing is at the top of sugarloaf.

Powder skiing aside, can someone that has skied both types of terrain answer a few questions:

1. Of course, different strokes for different folks, but how is wide open skiing compared to thin trails? To me, it looks *bleh*. You can see everything, you dont feel like you're on the mountain alone, you're skiing towards the lift. Whereas a weaving thin trail might be more about the journey? I don't know.
2. looking for a better version of east coast skiing, but more of the same style, it looks like Deer Valley and Panorama Canada might have what I'm looking for. Any ideas, thoughts?",1579282879.0,lewicki,1

I just got new skis (177 Volkl Mantra M5).  The shop took my experience rating,  weight, height and age(III, 180, 5'8""and 45) to set the DIN.  But they set my DIN to only 7, which I felt was low at the time.  On my first time out I test them by slamming  my skis into the snow sideways and slanted (similar angle to a hard carve) they popped off relatively easily.  This does not seem correct to me, but wanted others opinions.  

To qualify my skiing style, I carve fast and hard, hit smaller jumps and can traverse any Black Diamond I have come across. Most online tables put me at 8.5+.  So should I have them changed and should I do it myself?",1579131106.0,Bavic1974,1

eooh06,Rant: Children should be escorted by an adult in a terrain park,"Children are attracted to terrain parks like there's free candy at the landing. The problem is that they don't have the skills and lack the situational awareness to get out of the landings if they crash. Basically they starfish on the landing and wait for mommy and daddy to pick them up. 

My buddy almost landed on a child who had crashed on the landing and was completely invisible from above. He had given the child plenty of time to clear the jump, but without someone following behind, there's no way to signal to the skiers above.  

Here's an [example of a parent doing the right thing](https://youtu.be/wN7Q76Ecw4o?t=147). The child eats shit, the parent stays high and blocks the jump.",1579052162.0,Thexorretor,1
eouaj3,Advice wanted: How to ski through moguls?,"I'm an intermediate level skier and am pretty comfortable on most blues and groomed black diamond slopes.  However I've encountered moguls on most blacks and many blues, and they've thrown me off every time.  If they're small or the slope is shallow I can ski through them OK, but when they get large or the slope is steep they seem terrifying-- it feels like they constrain my path to the point where I won't be able to slow down as needed.  I find myself constantly stopping and evaluating the easiest path instead of going with the flow, and occasionally I've even just slid down areas on the side of my skis if they seem too hard to handle.  Do y'all have any advice or good videos on learning to ski down un-groomed slopes with larger moguls?",1579076560.0,rimfired,1
eovey5,How to start park skiing?,"Yo guys, so I’m on a winter season and i’d call myself quite advanced on piste. 

However I want to get more into park skiing / freestyle skiing in general but I just don’t have the gonads to send it on the bigger stuff. I’m currently holding out until a powder day when I can properly send it and get used to the air time off piste before going for it on groomed jumps

Do you guys have any tips for either park skiing or powder jumping? Or just any tips on jumping at all? 

Thanks x",1579081738.0,MyArkk,1

eoz4t0,"Sprained my ankle, now my boots are killing me","I sprained my right ankle in pretty badly in a climbing accident last year, and now my ski boots are causing me a lot of pain. The injury happened 9-10 months ago and it took me about a month to recover, but since then I haven't noticed any pain or issues climbing and running. Now that it's ski season though, my right boot is killing my ankle. The boots were fine last year and the left side still feels great, so I assume it's related to the injury. The pain is in my ankle and in the back of my foot, above the heel. Also, I noticed I'm not able to flex the boot as much on the injured side. I'm assuming the sprain lowered my ankle flexibility and now I'm in pain because the boot is bending my foot in a way it's not used to. 

Does anyone have suggestions for ankle strengthening/mobility exercises I could do to help loosen up my weak ankle and get it back in good shape? I did a google search, but there are tons of results and I'm not sure which exercises would be the most helpful for my situation. Also, do people think getting an insole for my boot could help? I'm not sure this would help, but maybe if it changes my foot angle a bit it could relieve some of the pain?",1579101690.0,kittykatmeowow,1
