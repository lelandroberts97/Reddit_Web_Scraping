dazzford,1.0,1580170804.0,euq1wg,"The past few years I had been watching /u/StompItTutorials videos on YouTube. The tricks and the energy really got me stoked and wanting to try stuff. Last season I started hitting some (for me) bigger jumps at Whiteface in their park and it was a ton of fun.

I then took a freestyle private lesson at my [local hill] (https://catamountski.com/) and started practicing 180s and switch.  I really was not very good or successful but it was fun and gave me the basics to practice with.

Just to give you a little context, [I’m 40] (https://imgur.com/0exL2Fy) and took about an 18 year break from skiing. I’ve been back into it the past couple seasons and cant get enough. My daily drivers are Nordica Enforcer 100s and can ski pretty much any trail on the hills on the /r/icecoast.

At the start of this season [Jens] (/u/StompItTutorials) put up 4 camps and I signed up almost immediately. When I was looking at these camps previously, there was not much info on them so I thought this might help others who are potentially interested.

I just got back Saturday the 25th from the camp.

**With the price of the camp you get:**

* 6 nights at Hotel Vorab in Flims (part of the LAAX ski area)
* Breakfast and Dinner included
* 5 day ski pass
* 5 days of coaching ([10 total participants with 2 coaches] (https://imgur.com/dvQbaG1))
* Video analysis of your day every evening
* 3 nights of trampoline workshop

**What you need to provide:**

* Travel to and from the hotel
* Your clothes
* Ski gear if you don’t want or need to rent (I rented and was given a brand new pair of Poachers)

**Here’s my take:**

* The accommodations are great. The Hotel Vorab is spotlessly clean; I mean impeccable. It has a ski room with boot dryers/heaters so you don’t need to bring yours. 
One thing to note; you will be expected to pay for tap water at dinner table service. It seems to be normal in Switzerland. The food was great.
* You will bunk with someone. Be prepared for that and bring earplugs. My roommate and I shared the same temperature preference so had no issues sleeping. I know this was not the same with everyone.
* Breakfast is great; it's a huge buffet with all the protein and carbs you could want.
* The lunch spots on the hill are [beautiful] (https://imgur.com/V2E5DIl). We were lucky with 5 [bluebird] (https://imgur.com/FzCjY9n) [days] (https://imgur.com/UScAooL), even with the Sahara dust causing a slight orange tint and haze the last 2.
* The majority of us were > 40 years old. This surprised me and I was expecting to be one of the oldest. 
We represented the following countries:
Australia, New Zealand, United States x 3, England, Greece, Spain, Italy, Netherlands
* [Jens](/u/StompItTutorials) suggests this camp is for anyone who can ski parallel. While technically that’s true, I know many parallel skiers who would be extremely challenged or intimidated by some of the slopes we hit hard. You should be comfortable carving well on any slopes including double blacks, and ideally enjoy charging hard and fast.
* So many of the tricks are predicated on proper ski form and technique, there is an emphasis on those and plenty of work done to make sure you’re working on it. I noticed a significant increase in my ski position awareness and my ability to carve well due to this.  **E.g. one foot skiing was something we did a bunch of and it really helps.**
* I think all of us made it from either never or [poorly hitting 180s] (https://imgur.com/8SeQqhw) to solidly hitting 180s on jumps and half of us hitting our first 360s.  A couple people got comfortable at and repeatedly hit multiple 360s. 
* Boxes hurt when you fall on them. Some people had crash pads; I wish I did.  By Friday my right hip was noticeably swollen and sore compared to my left.
* The pop is one of the most important things to nail correctly. Practice it now.
* The video analysis is a hugely valuable part of this camp. Breaking down your moves and showing what needs to change or what can improve was really helpful. A trick which seemed to go well on the slope could have a bunch of small things which were not correct.
* Those proline jumps are legit huge (no we did not get close to hitting them).  We skied over the knuckle and rollers and holy shit it makes you pucker up. One class member didn't realize you had to take it slow and had an unintentional 40 ft drop which he landed.
* We worked on pops, jumps, boxes, grinds, half pipe, [switch, 180s](https://youtu.be/pYRChbdy3HQ), 270s, 360s, grabs, and probably a few other things I neglected to mention.
* Jens and his co-coach Will are both great coaches and really genuine people. Every time someone hit something well or new you could hear them exclaim ""fuck yea!"". Also, when we were doing something incorrect, they would call out out.

Overall it was an amazingly rewarding time. It was so much fun to be with a group of people all working hard to learn and accomplish new things who could ski well in the first place. I rarely get to spend that kind of time with others these days.

RekrabGrimm,1.0,1580046251.0,eu2ug6,"When I took up skiing again a couple years ago after having not skied since I was in middle School I decided to add a helmet to my ski outfit. Yesterday, I was reminded why they're so important.

I was skiing a hill in Northern Hokkaido called Nayoro Piyashiri. It has some of the best snow in the entire region, not always the biggest snow falls but it's fluffy and deep, even in a bad season like this one. Yesterday it was snowing all day, and it had been snowing the night before, and most skiers stay off all but the easiest to access runs. My friend and I discovered one of the side runs was mostly untouched and full of knee-deep powder and completely ungroomed. After skiing some of the most beautiful on-piste terrain I've ever experienced we had to cross over from one run to the other where the powder got waist-deep. As I was making a turn, my skis crossed, and I fell hard. When I hit, my head connected with something frozen underneath the powder. Hard. It was really bad, I had to dig myself out and sit down and recover for a while. At that moment I was so grateful for my helmet. Even today my neck is extremely stiff from the hit I took. But because I was wearing a helmet I was able to continue skiing for the rest of the day and enjoy my day instead of getting a ride home in an ambulance.

I wasn't skiing in particularly difficult terrain, it was conditions I should have been able to contend with. This is a reminder that it doesn't matter what you're skiing on, no matter how good you are, it only takes a slight misstep and you could be looking at a traumatic brain injury. Don't take risks with your brain guys, good helmets are way cheaper than medical bills or a lifetime of brain damage. Ski safe!",LPT: always wear a helmet!

Skiing is an expensive hobby, relatively. Few things making it so:

1. lift tickets, lift (obviously) lifts you to higher altitude so that you can ski back to base. (100$/day)
2. Need to rent it otherwise you cant ski. ski boots, ski, poles : 60$/day
3. ski clothes. base thermals(20$), down jacket insulation(50$), waterproof exterior(50$), gloves, woollen hat, neck gaiter, merino wool socks, snow boots, snow goggles. (150$ one time)
4. travelling to ski resort, from home. It involves staying in a hotel, eating etc. (130$/day)
5. if you are going with family, their ski expenses as well, add to it. (xNumFamily)

Few optimizations to above expenses:

1. buy in off-season/as early as possible. Go to skiing resort early if you intend on spending whole day there. Everything takes time: reaching skiing resort, parking, getting lift ticket, getting skiing equipment.
2. find a place to rent it cheap somewhere. IT is bloody expensive that renting equipment costs as much as 60% of the lift ticket.
3. better to buy if you are going to frequent skiing (at least few basic necessities such as base thermals, socks etc). Else find a friend who can loan you for the weekend, if he isnt going on the same day :)
4. like any other travel accomodation, if max time is going to be spent on skiing, may not spend as much on hotel. Eat at a value restaurant (like chipotle ?)
5. spouse couldnt ski. She is a newbie and has bit of weight issue. dont take lift tickets for them. Buy on demand, if needed. She mostly helped kid with the skiing.

Notes:

* preparing for Skiing: talk to friends, watch youtube videos. unfortunately, nothing can prepare you for actual experience
* before putting on skiing equipment, eat food/hydrate/freshen up etc. its bloody tedious to unpack yourself and repack. given the clothing layers, skiing equipment etc.
* skiing is essentially, leverage your weight, gravity and your center of mass to push yourself (ski). breaking speed by snow plow(ing). sense of balance is v.v. essential.
* if you are speeding up, do SNOW PLOW.
* if its your first day

        + choose a `green` slope (easiest level).
        + forget about turns, simply ski down
        + you WILL fall down. It is essential to get up. Make sure you are prepared for it, as much as you can. I fell down 15 times, during first two lifts.
        + wasnt able to walk on skiis, it is required to board the lift.
        + wasnt able to get off the lifts, always crash landed on the slope.
        + ensure you hold poles correctly, by putting pole grip roundabouts in your wrist. so that whenever you fall down, the poles ll stay with you.
        + learn how to put on skiis and get off it. ensure skiis are put against the slope and you put on the downward ski first. use the poles to hold you steady before you put on your second ski.
        + getting off skis: reach a place where skis are against the slope, use poles to push the heel lock back, to unlock ski boots.
        + dont try to push skiis to the direction you want. try to leverage gravity and snow plow to push you into correct direction.
* you might have better control on one leg (right/left handed). That makes difficult to control speed/direction via the weaker leg.","first day of skiing: tips, notes"

I'm off to Big Sky next week, first time there. I'll have 3 full days of skiing and was looking for run recommendations. I'm used to skiing the Canadian Rockies and spoke with a friend who has skied both resorts across Canada as well as Big Sky and says that Big Sky inflates their run ratings +1 versus what things are in Canada. Basically, he says a green run here is a blue at Big Sky, a blue run here is a black at Big Sky, a black here is a double black at Big Sky, a double black here is a triple black at Big Sky. Greens at Big Sky would be like kiddie slopes/learning areas here. Is this true?

For starters, I doubt I'll be doing anything off Headwaters. I've heard it's great but also very rocky + cliffs. Not really my cup of tea. I'm fine with very steep runs, but prefer open bowls with room to turn over chutes, plus I don't really want to do the hike. Here in Canada I'm comfortable on any black and all but the very hardest double blacks.

I have a few questions about runs and would love suggestions for any of your favs/hidden gems. Also any specific tips accounting for current snow conditions (late January) would be great!

**South Side:**

Looking at photos, Hanging Valley off the back of Lone Peak looks like an awesome run, is it? Lenin and Marx are both musts, is the snow good on them right now? Is Bavarian Forest a good run? The trees don't look too dense.

Also, though I won't do Headwaters, I would consider the Gullies Traverse & Gullies 1/2/3 off Lone Peak. Are they easier/less sketchy than Headwaters?

**Front Side:**

What are the best blue/blacks off Swift Current/Ramcharger/Thunder Wolf. I expect we would probably spend the first day just exploring that part of the mountain without heading up Lone Peak. Any favs/suggestions?

The long blacks/blues off Six Shooter & Lone Tree look fine, but they seem really out of the way and a long lift back up to ski them. Are they worth it or should I skip?

Finally, is it worth hiring a guide for a half day to ski Big Couloir and North Summit Snowfield? I don't have any gear & def wouldn't ski them on my own, but after checking out videos/photos I think I would be comfortable skiing them with a guide.

I was skiing bowls and steeps and trees and bumps all day. On my way out I stopped by a hut for a drink of water and a bathroom stop. I took my helmet off inside and when I went back out I put the helmet on but didn't buckle it. My day was done and I was skiing a chill blue groomer to the main area of the resort to catch a bus home so I was being casual. I was skiing chill and in control and I just caught some dumb edge and smacked into the hardpack and my helmet flung off.

YarrowBeSorrel,1.0,1579263109.0,epv7ob,"Hey y'all,

I'm looking at getting a pair of xcountry skis for work. I do forestry work in the upper Midwest and am currently working on a very large area chock full of logging trails that are always open and clear. Think ungroomed snowmobile trails. I don't have a snowmobile or a way to transport one so I figured skis would be the next best option. 

Currently I've found that Nordic touring skis are the best bet for me as I would be on mainly ungroomed trails.

I'm debating between metal edged vs non. If I could get positives and negatives of each that would be great  I'm also trying to find a good boot.

My preference for boots would be to have one pair I could wear all day, skiing to my plots deep in the woods and walking around on the plots. These plots can be in wet areas like swamps and I can still bust through the ice, so I'm looking at something with a higher top, mid calf to knee high like muck boots. Waterproof and insulated as well. That way I don't have to drag more gear than necessary into the woods. Any ideas?

Any information would be appreciated! I have little experience in this field and I don't know what I don't know. So if you have questions for me please ask :)",Cross Country Skiing for work

Powder skiing aside, can someone that has skied both types of terrain answer a few questions:

1. Of course, different strokes for different folks, but how is wide open skiing compared to thin trails? To me, it looks *bleh*.

Looking to get some advice for an end of season ski trip with some friends. We are currently deciding between steamboat and salt lake. The week is March 27th-April 5th.  As it stands we are looking for the least expensive option. Flying in to both areas is about the same price. However, I will have a free place to stay in downtown salt lake. That said, The rates are a lot higher out there and may outweigh the steamboat pass + a house rental for 5 days. The steamboat pass has a 3 day ticket starting April 1 for $149. However, I can’t seem to find anything decently good in Utah for under $120 a day.

I wanted to see if anyone knew of any deals we could get that are that good out in salt lake, the resort doesn’t explicitly matter since it’s all good skiing.

I just got new skis (177 Volkl Mantra M5).  The shop took my experience rating,  weight, height and age(III, 180, 5'8""and 45) to set the DIN.  But they set my DIN to only 7, which I felt was low at the time.  On my first time out I test them by slamming  my skis into the snow sideways and slanted (similar angle to a hard carve) they popped off relatively easily.  This does not seem correct to me, but wanted others opinions.

GuyH0123,,1578166234.0,ek165m,"Last year we rented a car from Milan airport to the ski resort in **Campitello** ,

The cars usually don't come with Winter tires only with snow chains which is a huge problem and can be very

dangerous on the road.

1 hour before reaching **Campitello** it was snowing so the car wasn't stable and we needed to put on the snow chains

which apparently weren't suitable for the car and broke down after couple of minutes.

We were  stuck between towns at night trying to find someone to help us with a new snow chain!! eventually

we replaced the snow chains and arrived safely to the hotel.

My conclusions from this event is be very careful when taking a car to a ski resort from Milan !!! make sure there are winter tires and if not make sure that the snow chain are suitable for the car and you know how to put them ...it can really save your life :)",Don't rent a car from Milan to ski resorts!!

I am in the market for new boots and have been eyeing the K2 Recon &amp; Mindbender Boots and was curious on adaptability with specific bindings.  I am have been considering a pair of LOOK Pivot 12/14 GW bindings  (leaning towards 14gw) for the upcoming season and was unable to determine exactly if they are compatible with the aforementioned boot.  K2 say they are Alpine compatible and LOOK states it accepts Alpine (ISO 5355) boots; does this mean they will work with one another?  Been reading a ton of material trying to figure this out and finally decided I'm turning to Reddit for help.  If anyone knows of guides/helpful websites appreciate any and all links!

Fluorocarbons are harmful to human health. They causes cardiovascular disease, liver damage, hormone disruption and cancer. 

Each season thousands of vulnerable junior ski racers and their parents may be applying this toxic chemical onto their boards, race after race, without wearing the proper chemical safety gear.  Studies have found that during just one season, applying these waxes can cause a 254% increase of PFAS level in your blood stream.

Skiing with a fluorinated wax briefly gives you lower friction and higher speeds but at a detrimental cost. These toxic chemicals quickly leave your board, going into the snow, and eventually into our drinking water. 

GlideNano is the first to create a non-toxic, 100% biodegradable and EPA compliant ski wax that gives your board 40% less friction on snow or ice and lasts 5x longer!

I’m in the market for a new ski jacket. I’ve had a 3-in-1 TNF jacket for going on 8-9 years and it’s been fantastic. Used it as a ski and an everyday winter jacket, as well as both parts separately. The zipper on the outer shell is basically shot due to normal wear and tear. Trying to have it repaired by TNF but need (want) something for this season. I wanted another TNF jacket but I’m not wild about the color selection for this year. For me, warmth is the most important feature of the jacket.

DuxDrive,,1569916244.0,dbpzxg,"Greetings all,

I am skiing for over 20y on already 10 years outdated skis that done their job for all this time.Had no problems really except I couldn't keep up speed at cornering without leaning too much (unlike others) otherwise I'd lose grip/control and would have to back off a bit.

Last year went in Serre Chevalier and one circumstance led to another as we went in another ski center in Sestriere and i forgot my boots and it was perfect opportunity to try on new skis. I tried on new Head 3X (something) Head model skis I think, not sure, and I was mesmerized by the difference. I never thought a ski can make that much difference.

This year I am determined to get new skis before I go in Val Thorens and my dilemma is between the:

500 euro SuperShape I.Titan VS 250 euro V-Shape V4 (BOTH SKIS ARE ON -50%)

I see the supershape Titan is for all conditions, while the V-Shape would give me more confidence (enough) but as ... what can i say, 20y exp skier what these skiis can offer me in terms of performance?

Is it worth it to go and get the 500 euro skis, or the 250 ones?If anyone could give me an idea, it would really help me

We both have the IKON base pass.

We are both intermediate skiers-typically sticking to blues and this trip hopefully adding in more blacks. We have been to Copper, Winter Park, Eldora, Kicking Horse, and Breckenridge and are trying to go somewhere new!

Of course the views are all beautiful, but if there is anywhere that stands out I would love to know.

So far I am looking into the following, but am open to others on the IKON pass.

2. JACKSON HOLE
3. BANFF SUNSHINE/LAKE LOUISE RESORT/MT NOQUAY

I put together a list of the ones I've tried, and some notes in case anyone is interested, I'd also appreciate any advice on other skis I should consider.

Name | Waist | Length | My Personal Score | Notes 
---|---|---|---|----
Salomon QST 92 | 92mm | 185cm | 4/5 | Delightful to ski. Easily floats on slight powder, easy to turn, carve easily, able to ski switch and spin nicely, felt slow and stable.
Nordica Enforcer 93 | 93mm | 185cm | 3/5 | Little harder to turn, but sharper stronger turns, slightly worse going backwards. Bouncy is really nice though!
Atomic Bent Chetler 100 | 100mm | 188cm | 3/5 | Felt slow with sticky snow, but super stable and great on slush, holding an edge took the most effort compared to the others.
Blizzard Rustler 9 | 94mm | 188cm | 5/5 | Fun to ski! Less bouncy than the enforcer, but great for switch. Felt very in control. Bit unstable when flat and fast.
Blizzard Rustler 10 | 104mm | 188cm | 5/5 | So fun to ski! Super stable when slow, handles slush the best, not slow on flats. Edging is a little effort but better than chetler, maybe worse than qst but I was tired when reviewing this as this was my last ski of the day. Great on slushy moguls, sharp tight turns and forgiving. Bit unstable when flat and fast. Slightly more work than 9 on groomed maybe.

I've been enjoying learning to ski switch, doing little spins and small hops off bumps and going between trees on the easier groomed runs. Since i'm still pretty new to the sport I've been mostly on-piste, which makes me hesitate to go up to 100mm widths, however I'm also quite tall and big, and the demo guys said since I'm a west coaster the rustler 10 probably makes more sense as an all mountain ski for me.

I like the playfulness of the Rustler series, but they and the Bent Chetler felt slightly flat underfoot, whereas the Enforcer's bounce was really nice for longer turns, something rustler felt more unstable on. I guess this is a trade-off. I also worry I'm getting too wide a ski since I currently ski on-piste 3/4 of the time.

I'm also hoping to find a good deal on a ski to buy either this month or before next season. Is it worth waiting till next season to buy with pre-season discounts, or the best deals basically now?

I'm going to try demoing the Line Sick Day 104, Enforcer 100 and QST 99 when I get a chance as well. I'm currently leaning towards the Rustler 10 @ 188cm.

Skis I've decided not to go for due to lack of partial twin tip or lack of forgiveness:

- Volkl M5 Mantra
- Blizzard Bonafide
- Blizzard Brahama
- Atomic Vantage 90

**My background:**
I'm a first season skier on the west coast (Tahoe / Squaw) with about 12 days and several ski lessons in, which has gotten me where I'm comfortable with most blues in Squaw on (75%) and off (25%) piste, ski instructors usually put me in strong intermediate classes now. I hope to improve to early advanced by or during next season (still have ~4-5 days left to go season).

---
**Note for future readers**: I bought the Blizzard Rustler 10's in 188cm length. Spent a whole day demoing it from icy mornings to ducking into trees in the Shirley side and found the skis did everything I hoped they would.

4 days on them so far, they've been fantastic for everything from bombing down groomed blues, handling slushy moguls, picking my way between trees, doing small jumps, and learning to ski switch. I just conquered my first black diamond (Sibera Bowl) with them!","Choosing a playful west-coast all mountain intermediate ski for a big and tall guy (6'4"" 200lb / 193cm 91kg)"

&amp;#x200B;

So a little background, I am beginner- intermediate skier. Have skied a handful of times in the past 10 years. I can make it down diamond trails if I have to. Not my preference however. Not really a speed chaser. Kinda just like to go at a decent speed I can control without having to ""pizza"" the whole time and cruise down the hills.

I went 3 times in the past 3 months so far. Second time, I felt like my skis were too long and I didn't feel like I was ""one"" with my skis (kept crossing, felt too heavy for me) . 3rd time,  I asked for shorter skis and got 142cm and they felt really good.

WingedGeek,,1551221569.0,av5s6v,"I recently got back into skiing. I'm about 45 minutes from Big Bear by air, about 2 hours and change from Mammoth, 2.5-3 hours from Tahoe. With two large dogs at home, most of my trips are day trips, though my boss has a place in Heber City (~4 hours by air, and the pups love to fly) I *might* visit once, *maybe* twice, in a season (Deer Valley).

I'm thinking the Ikon $649 ""Base Pass"" makes the most sense. The black-out dates aren't that unreasonable (12/26-31, Sat and Sun on MLK weekend, Sat and Sun on President's Day weekend) and don't apply to Big Bear. So far this year I've gone out once in St. Louis, then bought skis, and have been up four times since then (Snow Summit x3, Heavenly x1 - which, I know the Ikon isn't ""in network"" there, but I can come in to Truckee and ski Squaw Valley). I'll definitely be up more this season (and as I understand it, the 19/20 pass starts working this spring?), so I feel like even if I always planned ahead and got the $80 lift tickets at Snow Summit (which, let's face it, I don't), the pass would pay for itself pretty quickly just in what I'm already doing, let alone if I get invited up to Deer Valley or make Mammoth a habit.

Ill be the first to admit.... I'm a total skiing newbie, having only been skiing twice. This isn't the typical din setting question. 

The first time I was on a pair of skis, I had a tiny bit of difficult getting into my skis simply because it took some time to get used to. After that, I was fine, and could take them on and off as needed. 

The second time, however, it literally took me over 45 minutes to get into my bindings, with maximum effort and doing my best to get the snow off the boots, etc, in relatively the same conditions as the first time. .  I was using rentals, and my ski instructor said that perhaps the rental guys set the din too high. Is there truth to this?

I've been reading about din settings, but can't really find anything concrete. It makes sense to me that a lower din runs the risk of prerelease, and a higher din makes it more difficult to release, but is this also true of getting IN to the bindings (a high din making it harder to get back into the bindings)?

mu7x,,1550002257.0,apxn1y,"To be honest, this is more to satisfy my curiosity than advice I will use. 

So I tried a low volume (qst pro and I think the x max is the same fit) and a medium volume salomon boots (x pro).  Low volume boot was super painful since it crushed the top of my ankle when I tried to tighten them up, so I went with the X Pros, which fit well.

Now with custom shell, the boot can mold and expand to your foot in certain spots.  This is great for forefoot width, BUT does it also impact volume?

In other words, may a low volume boot, with heat molding form a closer more responsive  fit after head molding compared to a medium volume boot that experiences little to zero expansion after heat molding near the instep region, since it already conforms to the users instep.

I can side-slip forever, and manage to stay upright and steer as needed, but control at speed is an issue. He can point his skis straight down, go fast, and somehow maintain control (usually on the sides where there's more powder.) 

But once I point downhill and get speed, all bets are off- I have to hockey-stop and start again, or make wide turns across the whole slope. 

He emphasizes that I need to lean forward almost on tip-toe but that makes the backs come up and I have to lean back to get them down again. The ski seems designed to steer from the center, not the tips the way he describes.

My wife and I are leasing a pair of skis and boots from a local bike and ski shop run by a friend, and have a night pass to the closest mountain.  This is a trial season for us to see if we like the mountain, ski experience and the 3 hour round trip enough to justify buying our own gear for next year.

I've always been pretty picky about shoe and boot fit for footwear because my left foot has just enough of a bigger bump on the outside side which just seems to hit seams or _something_ which can make the fit go from comfortable to tolerable to pretty darn uncomfortable pretty quick.  I have the same bump in the same spot on the other foot, but its about maybe 2/3rds the size. 

The ski boots we leased seem to be doing that quite a bit and I suspect it's significantly aggravated because ski boots are pretty tight fitting in the best of times.  Sometimes, coming down from the mountain, I need to head to the lodge and pull the boot off to let the foot chill out a bit. This is with a brand new boot liner and moleskin wrapped around the area.

DikkeTosti1998,,1548366700.0,ajhq2j,"Hi,

I'm going on a ski trip with some friends in a week. We planned on renting skis. Now I thought about renting twin tips for the first time. Never rode twin tips before so seems fun to do some experimenting in switch skiing or trying 180's. Only wonder whether the normal slope/mogul skiing is very different on twin tips. I read about twintips being quicker in turning. Also, a friend of mine told me most rental twintips are pretty beaten up due to people grinding rails and the such. Don't know if this is true though.

I think of myself as an average skier, not that technically good, but can go down any prepped slope, sometimes go off-piste if it's not too crazy. I'm skiing in France. (Thought this might help in advice)

Thanks!

Edit:  Thanks for all the advice! Just got back and we had a great trip.  Snow was pretty poor by Colorado standards, but the weather was sunny and great (15 to 35 degrees), and it was still mostly better snow than I was used to skiing back east.  There were some brown spots, exposed rocks, and icy patches by my second day, but not a huge deal.  The important thing is that I was able to pretty quickly get back to skiing the intermediate and advanced intermediate terrain.  I did upgrade to the intermediate ski on day one, but they recommended a pretty short ski (165 I think).  They really built my confidence quickly, but I was pretty damn slow on the catwalks. I'll try to get into the low 170's next time with some slightly longer poles.  The new skis were amazing, and I had to retrain my self not to work so hard to turn and carve. A few times I spun out on icy spots due to trying too hard to turn, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly. 

Also, WP was great! So much variety in terrain, and almost the whole mountain was open to my skill level. Only real frustration was going too slow on catwalks and gentle slopes. I skied all areas other than Eagle Wind (snow sucked there, and too hard). Loved Mary Jane until the crowds showed up, and then spent most of my time on the long intermediates deeper in Winter Park Territory (Lonesome Whistle + Olympia Express was always open). Even with the crowds, it was still possible to be alone on a run, and I got to be the first person on many groomed trails early each morning. Parsenn bowl was  stunning- I'd never skied above treeline before, and the weather was great for it. The Parry's Peak trail was just right for me on this trip.  Skiing single let me sneak into many lift lines (like Panoramic Express) quickly until around 11 am on Saturday when the crowds really showed up.  All in all, I did about 45 miles of trails in two days over 30+ runs. Amazing experience. ",Help for first ski trip in a while...

I'll have to buy a new pair of boots, so I'll need advice on flex. I'll have to learn again how to ski propperly (wasn't a 'pro' but I was quite good at it). As my learning curve will be shorter now, which flex would you recommend me for 76kg and knowing that I like to go fast? (I love super giant).

About skis, I have my Elan carving ones (quite new as I've only used one season since bought), but as I have grown up a bit (25y old right now) the ones I have from then are long enough to reach my mouth. Are long enough to start again and then buy longer ones once I've reached my old level?

I didn't care much about material sizes, flex, etc (as a kid I didn't care as I used what my parents bought me) but now I want to go a step forward and get the right material in order to reach a good level (would like to compete in giant/super giant).",Replacing skis?

Thought I’d crowd source some advice. New (ish) to skiing - am comfortable on Canadian blues and can bumble down blacks.

I’d like to take my skiing to the next level - want to get much more control on turns, more comfortable on ice and just pretty much tidy it all up.

I’ve never had lessons and am looking at taking some classes.

Cost of 4 x3 hour classes (8:1 student: instructor ratio) comes to CAD: 230.

Alternatively I’m thinking of buying this:

I like the constant feedback and given that I plan on skiing 4-5 days a week until season ends I’m wondering whether I’d get more value out of this?

Ultimate goal is back country/off piste stuff but at this stage want to get to be that nothing on piste can be a challenge (so enjoy black and double black runs)

Just picked a pair of these (177s, 140,76,118) at the swap for $40 USD. They are in fantastic shape. Bases are wonderful, edges not wore down. Marker(?) bindings are worn, but not brutalized. 

Any thoughts on these? Any experience?? Trying to get a handle on them and why so cheap? Reviews seem pretty solid.

I have issues with my toes getting extremely cold sometimes, often ending up feeling like they are going to fall off/I just can’t feel them anymore after even just 30 min of skiing in cold weather. 

This seems to be an unpredictable issue, aka no matter how much I warm up my feet and boots beforehand there is a 50/50 chance my toes will be freezing within the hour. Other 50% of the time my toes are just fine.

So my question: are there any socks that are designed to keep your toes warm or promote circulation of your feet? The one requirement is that they need to be extremely thin as I have tight fitting boots that were molded to my feet. ",Thin ski socks for cold toes

I recently (~6 months ago) moved to central Massachusetts for school. I'd like to pick up a set of skis (probably on the used market) that are good all around.

I am looking around to buy some skis this season and today I went to a few shops in my city to ask about the Salomon SMAX 10/8 and XDR 80/79 but a man who dealt in Salomon for years told me that recently he consciously backed out of doing business with Salomon due to a drop in quality of their skis, allegedly ever since they and Atomic joined forced (is that true?) instead he recommended Nordica as the best brand of ski at the moment. I am somewhat sceptical as it seemed he was selling Nordica exclusively which always screams ""sponsor"" to me (ironically when I told him about Salomon skiis topping skitests he said not to trust those due to sponsoring deals which is fair enough but...) He showed me an atomic ski which was brought in for service and the side of it was completely disjointed revealing a somewhat flimsy looking construction (don't take my word for this, I'm hardly an expert but it sort of looked that way).

lpass17,,1539955128.0,9pjqcv,"Anyone else here have this problem. There is so little out there in terms of advice or even acknowledgment. I have an external tibial torsion, which means my lower leg bone curves outward putting my feet at a pretty significant duck stance. I was hoping I could physio a fix, but the orthopedist said only very expensive elective surgery could fix it, which means I'm stuck with duckfeet.

This complicates my skiing because once I click into my ski's I have to rotate my legs and knees inward to make my ski's parallel.  This does two things: it puts a part of my quad that I usually don't use under constant contraction and because me knees are now turned in at a weird and unnatural angle, I cannot get my ski's on edge.  My quads fatigue quickly no matter how much I work out before ski season, while my lazy overweight friends can ski all day with no problem.

Through Google I saw a couple of companies that tried to address it through duck mounted bindings, but there apparently wasn't much of a market and they folded.  

I've been to many specialized bootfitters with no real luck. Last winter I went to bootfitter who fits some professionals and his honest assessment was that I was not built for skiing and that there isn't a boot made for me.  

I imagine there has got to be more people like me, maybe some who have figured out something that helps.

Most shops won't mount bindings at a duck foot position, due to liability and most shops have no idea what I'm talking about anyway. That would also limit me to a fatter ski. 

I've taken a lot of lessons over the years and not a single instructor ever thought to look at my natural stance and take that into consideration when trying to teach me.  I did eventually learn how to ski on my own and would be considered an advanced intermediate, but my physiology seems to limit any improvement past that.

I'm so jealous of people with straight feet lol. When I'm on the lift and let my legs naturally relax, my skis shoot out to the sides to the point that I worry my left ski is going to hit the lift stanchions!

Private lessons are also provided (3x the price) with a choice of 2, 3, and 5 hour courses. Should I do privates first then group lessons? Would you guys suggest doing the 2.5 hours then do solo practice, or do the whole 4.5 hours? How many days should I spend on lessons?

I am looking for a ski that is able to ski everything pretty well. For example, powder, hardpack, groomers, moguls, and crud. Park is not as important to me. I am looking for a ski that is between 95-105 underfoot width.

Mystifizer,,1508447682.0,77hfgt,"Hi folks,

I've been riding for a long time, and 99% of the time I've mounted my bindings at the center -3cm on twins.

I bought a pair of zag slap XL 2016 for less than 200$, and even though i'm so thrilled to try them, I honestly do not know where to 
have them drilled. 

Should I measure the surface between both rockers and go center -3, or buy demo bindings and have them mounted at the recommended line?

Any help is appreciated.","ZAG slap XL, binding position"

I'm looking for all-round skis for my boyfriend, who started to ski last year and is getting really good at it for a beginner. We're looking for sth that will serve him for several years, so no total-beginner stuff. I'm going to get Fischer Progressor F19 for myself (I'm skiing for +20 years), I was also thinking about getting the same for him, but I'm not sure he will handle these. What do you think about this model for an early-intermediate? Maybe you have other options in mind? Thanks for any help.",Best all-round ski equipment for soon-to-be-intermediate

urban_equestrian,,1507441666.0,7502ss,"Hi,

I've been skiing a handful of times and have season passes for Heavenly (Tahoe Epic Pass) this year and would like to purchase skis.  Trying to figure out what type is maddening.  Given the following specific info, what would you recommend?

- Female, 5'10"", 125 lbs (tall and thin)
- Intermediate skiier (comfortable on most blues, just starting to try a black diamond here and there)
- Planning to run on mostly groomed slopes with occasional deeper powder runs
- I think I want a balance between maneuverability and stability at speed 
- Would like skis with integrated bindings

I've had the Rossignol Temptation skis suggested, but even then there seems to be a wide range of waist widths- help?",Looking for women's ski recommendations given some very specific inputs
