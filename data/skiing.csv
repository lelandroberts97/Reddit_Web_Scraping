First set of skis.,"So I am thinking about getting my first skis ( I am 15, 80kg, and 185 cm tall) I don't have my own boots cos my feet are still growing. I am looking at getting my first set of skis having skid since 2 and having been advanced for several years I wanted to get some freeride skis for backcountry touring that would also work really well on piste. I was looking at getting some atomic bent chetler 100s with an atomic shift binding. I am looking to keep it cheap, on [bluetomato.com](https://bluetomato.com) there are bent chetler for £360 and the shift bindings are about the same. Do you guys think that this is recommended, I am open to suggestions, I have heard that they are really good that is all. Thanks in advance for the help.",skiing,1579818807,D3470,True,2020-01-23,1

Niseko Danger,"Just trying to get a general feel for how dangerous the out of bounds/gated areas are at Niseko (and Rutsutsu).

It seems to me that historically Japan has been very restrictive about letting people go off Piste at all, and they really stress that you need to have avalanche gear (which I do have) etc. because they aren't patrolled areas (though I understand they do avalanche control and are actually patrolled).  It seems to me that many of the areas that are gated would be considered in bounds at many resorts in the US (not counting the gates that you can take you down the other side of the mountain and completely outside the resort).

I'm not trying to boast my skills or something but I would consider myself advanced and do enjoy gladed areas.  I've been to Colorado (Vail, Breckenridge, Copper), Utah (Park City), Whistler, Tahoe (everything) etc. and have been in terrain that I would consider more extreme and dangerous than from what I've seen in photos of Japan.

We will be doing a guided tour though likely not at Niseko, and being in a group with people that are capable skiers with some common sense but are maybe a bit afraid of going through a 'gate,' just trying to get a feel for what its really like out there.

Beginner question: Should I be putting more trust in my skis?,I'm relatively new to skiing as of november 2018 and went skiing in killington VT a couple of weeks ago. I picked up a pair of Dynastar contact 4x4's for cheap on craigslist. From what I've read those skiis  are above my pay grade when it comes to skill level but I gave them a try anyway. They felt way heavier than I was used to and when I got onto steeper runs and tried to let the skiis take themselves into turns I felt like I was going way to fast for my comfort zone. I could feel the grip on the snow but was hesitant because how fast I felt I was going. I want to go back in a few weeks.

Problems with new boots,"I just bought new boots. Went to a great boot fitter, he measured my feet and found 4-5 different pairs he recommended for my feet.

Went skiing with them yesterday, and while skiing they are absolutely amazing! No pain, and no hey give me so much control compared to every other boot I’ve ever worn. 
Problem is when I’m not skiing. Any time I’m in the lift or just standing still they are really uncomfortable on the outside of my feet, to the front near the toes. After 2-3 hours of skiing I took them off, and my left foot had this “falling asleep”, numb feeling.

Skis popped off even with correct DIN setting?,"So I have my skis set to the recommended DIN for my height/weight/sole length/skiing type. I'm fairly aggressive and ski pretty fast. I didn't have them pop off during the first few days of the season where I was skiing 90% groomers at high speeds. Then the other day it was snowing, my ski hit a reasonably small, fluffy pile of fresh snow and it just... Popped off. Now I wasn't even close to my max speed, I was completely in control and should've just skied over it with no trouble. It puzzles me that it came off so easily, and I'm wondering if it's the DIN setting or if I just hadn't properly locked the boot into the binding. Should I get the DINs bumped to a slightly higher value even though I'm technically on the right setting? Does anyone ski with higher than recommended DINs for this reason?

Looking for a reliable skiing app on WearOS,"Hi all,

I'm looking for a reliable skiing app for me and my dad.
We both have smartwatches running WearOS.

I used to use Strava (many moons ago) and last season I used the Goofle Fit app but found them both quite buggy. They didn't seem to track my runs vs lift time or my altitude change or just doubled up so it looked like I'd done 20 runs instead of 10.

I'm looking for something like the tracking app for my goggles (recon engage) but as they're pretty old now and support has long since stopped, there's no chance of a watch app.

To those of you that have been, how did you find it? What is the off piste like? Is it big enough to go for a full week or would you go for less time? I can see that there are lots of trees, are they too dense to ski between because that seems like it would be fun?

How much did you spend in total and what was your daily spend for things like food/drink? I've totted it up to be about £700/pp for a week including all food/lift pass/ski hire etc.

Help me,So I'm a teenager and I'm a expirenced skiier and I'm in a place with no real mountains for a few hundred miles so I go to a large hill which is a resort. But one thing I can't figure out is how to go through gravel like snow... Think baseball/ golfball sized chunks and they are mostly where the trial isn't groomed so when it's either I'm not paying attention much or trying to get over to a certain part of the hill I got to go through this stuff and what happens is (This problem is worse when I'm turning) I start going through it great and as I go through it my skis are sinking down (not a problem I can handle that easily) but the shock of hitting so much stuff is causing me to excessively bend my knees to take the shock and eventually I'm super backseated and just trying to stand up and since my knees are fully bent I can take the dips and end up getting lose and the skis have control rather than me usually I fall over or I stick my hand into the snow on purpose to try and slow myself down.

Ski touring backpack - camera gear?,"Wondering if anyone has found a great ski touring backpack that also can do a decent job carrying some camera gear (DSLR setup) - generally means bigger volume/weight carry?

My thinking is to carry the camera on my peak design capture clip while skinning, but then store the camera while skiing down - and this means putting it inside the pack (or some form of safe external carry?)

Somewhat related is that a LOT of the backpacks I've found seem to be hydration bladder-oriented, with minimal/no support for water bottle... which means just stuffing the water bottle in the main bag? Hesitate to store my water bottle inside my bag, with my camera in there because if it leaked open that could be a lot of water on expensive gear.",skiing,1579392322,kaitlyn2004,True,2020-01-18,1

3 Questions:

* Saw this in Racewax's website and wondering if brushing ""tail to tip"" is a thing. I couldn't find any other info about it. 

""You can also use brass to renew your base structure and open pores for improved wax absorption. Do this by brushing tail to tip. Pores get beat down in the tip to tail direction and close. Brushing with brass in the opposite direction (tail to tip) can open the pores.""

* How do I know I have brushed enough before and after the hot wax? 
* Should I use a gummi stone before or after filing/diamond stone?

What is your favorite tool to sharpen edges [technical],"Recently moved to study near the mountains and am currently heavily using my seasons pass. Thing is, I don't get home enough often enough to use my dad's stuff to sharpen the edges.

What is your way to sharpen them? File Guide with a medium coarse file plus a diamond and aluoxyd stone like the Worldcup Servicemen or a normal roller guided sharpener like the TOKO Edge Tuner Pro??

My dad has the Holmenkol Carve Edge and I really dislike it. Flimsy and only takes their own file size. My only concern with file guides is that the file rubbing on them is reducing the accuracy after some time. And that they potentially won't be able to closely follow the curvature of my R10,5 155cm Slalom Skis.

Lesson/Training Suggestions for Non-Beginner,"My situation -- went skiing probably 3-4 times as a kid, mostly on small east coast mountains. Remember liking it but not being great at it. 

Got back into it in Stowe, VT in 2014. Struggled first time back out there, but picked it up enough to easily conquer all green terrain and some blue terrain. 

Went back to Stowe again in 2016. Have since made two trips to Heavenly in Tahoe. Usually ski 3-4 days per trip. So I bet I have 20 total skiing days in my life under my belt. 

I am to the point where I can easily zoom down any kind of green slope. Last trip to Tahoe, I handled a handful of blue slopes without trouble. However, when things get a little steeper, or a little choppier, or a little bit crowded, I struggle. I have a lot of fear at the top of the mountain and it can be debilitating. I especially struggle in poor visibility when slopes are a bit steep. 

My issue at this point is that I've never been taught much of anything, so I don't have a lot of confidence in my technique. I get uncomfortable picking up any kind of speed heading downhill, so I try to make dramatic, sharp turns when I probably don't need to. Obviously this becomes more challenging when the terrain is steeper, so it makes it harder/more tiring than it needs to be. 

What sorts of lessons would help? I'm at the level where simply going down the smaller green slopes is very easy and doesn't expose my issues, which I suspect are based more in a lack of confidence.  I have one time in my life skied an entire day of blues without falling, if that gives some indication. But if conditions aren't perfect, I sometimes lack the confidence to even get started down a tougher hill. 

Suggestions? I want to be able to ski some of the terrain with family who are able to fairly easily topple any blue but stop short of the blacks most times.",skiing,1579462050,How_About_a_Fresca,True,2020-01-19,1

Friendly reminder to wear AND BUCKLE/FASTEN your helmet.," This is just a friendly reminder and PSA to wear a helmet and also buckle/fasten it and to remember that falls happen when you least expect it.

I was skiing bowls and steeps and trees and bumps all day. On my way out I stopped by a hut for a drink of water and a bathroom stop. I took my helmet off inside and when I went back out I put the helmet on but didn't buckle it. My day was done and I was skiing a chill blue groomer to the main area of the resort to catch a bus home so I was being casual. I was skiing chill and in control and I just caught some dumb edge and smacked into the hardpack and my helmet flung off. It still took the impact for me so that's good but it could have been much more painful. Thankfully (and super embarrassingly) I fell right by some patrollers standing by a slow sign. They grabbed the helmet and helped me laugh it off ""i'd be lying if I said that hasn't happened to me"" one of them said.
Thankfully it was my last run of the day and it did nothing to impact the ski day for me.

It's just a reminder to be focused all the time. Falls happen when you least expect so wear a helmet and make sure it stays on your head! If I hadn't had a helmet a silly fall from me not paying attention could have been concussion city.

Oversized boots for Atomic Tracker 16,"First off, as a longtime lurker on this sub, thanks for the years of excellent advice and content!   


I recently purchased a used pair of powder oriented Atomic skis, mainly because they came with a set of Atomic Tracker 16s (smalls). The price was quite low, so I bought them knowing my boots might be slightly big - in which case I will just resell them.   


The issue: My boots are 28.5 (325mm). The Tracker range is 265-230mm. My boot does fit into the binding without any hassle. The concern is that they 'just' fit - the boot scrapes the back of the binding a bit before sitting into place to push down/ lock in. Once it's in, it is snug. It's not a hassle to get into apart from the clear maxed out size of the boot.   


My concern is, is this too snug? Will this prove to be a major issue if I were to crash (binding not releasing etc.) or is there any way to make them work?

"Beginner-intermediate with narrow fit: ""normal boots"" or Full Tilt with swapped tongue?","Hey guys, first of all let me say that I'm amazed by the richness of information of this forum, truly a ""must go to"" place for great info on skiing. 

**Short question**: Does it make sense for a beginner with a narrow foot that only runs ""on piste"" to buy a Full Tilt Classic Pro and swap the tongue to a soft flex? 

I have been renting ski boots for three seasons and now I think it's time to buy my own. The problem I face most of the time is that I feel my foot loose and my ankle not locked in place enough . I partially solved this problem by going down one number since initially I used Mondo 26.0 and now I am renting 25.5 boots. I measured my foot and it's 25.7mm in lenght and 97mm in width.

I came to realize that narrow boots (last of 98mm-100mm) are offered almost only with mid to high flex (100-140), whereas a beginner boot with low to mid flex are most of the time available with wide last (102-104mm). I mentioned to the shop owner I rent from that I would like to buy a pair of boots and he said I should go for ""flex 90 or 100, so you can use them for many years"". The problem is that feel a 100 flex is too much for me since I am just a beginner.

I am aware that it's extremly important to go to a boot fitter, but what if the brands he carries do not offer a begginer's narrow ski boot? Shouldn't I first check the brands which eventually would suit me better based on last and flex and then choose a boot fitter accordingly?

That being said, I noticed that Full Tilts have 99mm last and in theory you can change the flex by changing the tongue.  I found some interesting deals here in Europe on the ""Drop Kick"" and the ""Classic Pro"" which made me think: do you think it would be a good idea to buy a ""Full Tilt Classic Pro"", that comes with ""flex 8"" (\~100), and change to a tongue of ""flex 4"" (\~70)? I'm 5ft6"" and 145 lbs and currently only do ""on piste"" downhill. My reasoning to go for the Full Tilt instead of other traditional  ""all mountain"" boots is that they will allow me to increase the flex as I improve my skiing (currently doing blue and red slopes, parallel skiing, but still learning how to carve).  

Can you suggest any other brands &amp; models for narrow feet?

We have come to love and trust many ski families and we look forward to skiing with them each and every Winter weekend. We cherish every day, we are able to spend on the slopes with these families, and this one family featured in this film; well no words can describe our love for them. This family always has some sort of adventure without planning it and no matter what the ski conditions are, they always make the best of it.

SkiBig3 IKON family and friends discount vs buying online,"Hi everyone, 
Already posted this on r/ikonpass but there’s only 270 people in that sub so I thought I’d try here too.

Going to Banff/LL in a few weeks and trying to figure out the best deal for ski tickets for my girlfriend.

On skibig3.com the ikon pass discount allows you to buy a 3 day ticket for $332.

The price of a single day ticket on the Banff Sunshine/LL websites is $124.

Using the ikon family and friends 25% discount that would make a ticket each day about $95 meaning that 3 days of skiing would cost $285 through buying at the window at the resort.

Has anybody else skied at Skibig3 that can confirm it is in fact a WORSE deal to buy “ikon deal” online than to buy a ticket at the window using your IKON pass discount?",skiing,1579631028,12manyNs,True,2020-01-21,1

Pressure on bottom of feet causing dull to moderate pain?,"Sup Ski Fam,

Question for you - when skiing I usually get a dull to moderately strong pain on the entire bottom of my foot. I have custom shell, custom lining from a reputable boot fitter (120 stiffness). To combat this, I unstrap on the lifts which helps a lot. That said, I still get some pain.

1) would custom foot beds help? - only part that is not custom 
2) what else may be causing this / or is it just the boot stiffness?

Big Sky Run Suggestions,"*^(I posted this in the megathread and after more than a day it didn't receive any replies and was buried so I'm posting it here.)*

I'm off to Big Sky next week, first time there. I'll have 3 full days of skiing and was looking for run recommendations. I'm used to skiing the Canadian Rockies and spoke with a friend who has skied both resorts across Canada as well as Big Sky and says that Big Sky inflates their run ratings +1 versus what things are in Canada. Basically, he says a green run here is a blue at Big Sky, a blue run here is a black at Big Sky, a black here is a double black at Big Sky, a double black here is a triple black at Big Sky. Greens at Big Sky would be like kiddie slopes/learning areas here. Is this true?

For starters, I doubt I'll be doing anything off Headwaters. I've heard it's great but also very rocky + cliffs. Not really my cup of tea. I'm fine with very steep runs, but prefer open bowls with room to turn over chutes, plus I don't really want to do the hike. Here in Canada I'm comfortable on any black and all but the very hardest double blacks.

I have a few questions about runs and would love suggestions for any of your favs/hidden gems. Also any specific tips accounting for current snow conditions (late January) would be great!

**South Side:**

Looking at photos, Hanging Valley off the back of Lone Peak looks like an awesome run, is it? Lenin and Marx are both musts, is the snow good on them right now? Is Bavarian Forest a good run? The trees don't look too dense.

Also, though I won't do Headwaters, I would consider the Gullies Traverse &amp; Gullies 1/2/3 off Lone Peak. Are they easier/less sketchy than Headwaters?

**Front Side:**

What are the best blue/blacks off Swift Current/Ramcharger/Thunder Wolf. I expect we would probably spend the first day just exploring that part of the mountain without heading up Lone Peak. Any favs/suggestions?

The long blacks/blues off Six Shooter &amp; Lone Tree look fine, but they seem really out of the way and a long lift back up to ski them. Are they worth it or should I skip?

Finally, is it worth hiring a guide for a half day to ski Big Couloir and North Summit Snowfield? I don't have any gear &amp; def wouldn't ski them on my own, but after checking out videos/photos I think I would be comfortable skiing them with a guide.

Any intermediate ski recommendations for east coast? ~500$ including boots,"I've skied about 20 times in the past 10 years, 5 of them this season. I've always rented equipment at the resort, but the last teacher I had recommended I get my own gear at this point since he thinks I'm past the beginner point and the rental gear might limit me. So here I am, I've always relied on whatever the rental shop had so I don't know much about skis and looking for some feedback. My current level: I can go down on blues, I can carve and have no issues linking turns.  Blacks are still a no-no and when I say I can go on blues, that's when they are not too icy. I live in NYC area and I mostly plan on skiing in east coast resorts that tend to have icy conditions. If I can find a ski that can handle east coast icy conditions, some light offtrail that I might want to add in the future and the occasional trip to the west coast that would be great. But if no such ski exist, my priority is something that carves well and can handle the hard pack of this area.

Need advice on what level ski's to rent,"I'm hoping someone could steer me in the right direction on what ski's I should rent. 

I do an annual trip with some friends to Utah every year. I would consider myself an average skier. After a few warm up runs, I usually get bored of blue's and work my way to blacks. We do go off course on occasion. Not much more than that. 

I know absolutely nothing about ski gear however. Usually, I just walk into a ski shop, tell them my situation and ask them what they recommend to rent, and it's always the ""performance"" package.

Is this the right move for me? For reference, there are 3 levels; Sport, Performance and Demo (not sure if other ski shops have different names for their levels). Would it be worthwhile to dish out the extra $12 per day for the demo package? Would I notice a difference? I'm 6'2 220 (again, no idea if that matters).

2. Need to rent it otherwise you cant ski. ski boots, ski, poles : 60$/day
3. ski clothes. base thermals(20$), down jacket insulation(50$), waterproof exterior(50$), gloves, woollen hat, neck gaiter, merino wool socks, snow boots, snow goggles. (150$ one time)
4. travelling to ski resort, from home. It involves staying in a hotel, eating etc. (130$/day)
5. if you are going with family, their ski expenses as well, add to it. (xNumFamily)

Few optimizations to above expenses:

1. buy in off-season/as early as possible. Go to skiing resort early if you intend on spending whole day there. Everything takes time: reaching skiing resort, parking, getting lift ticket, getting skiing equipment.
2. find a place to rent it cheap somewhere. IT is bloody expensive that renting equipment costs as much as 60% of the lift ticket.
3. better to buy if you are going to frequent skiing (at least few basic necessities such as base thermals, socks etc). Else find a friend who can loan you for the weekend, if he isnt going on the same day :)
4. like any other travel accomodation, if max time is going to be spent on skiing, may not spend as much on hotel. Eat at a value restaurant (like chipotle ?)
5. spouse couldnt ski. She is a newbie and has bit of weight issue. dont take lift tickets for them. Buy on demand, if needed. She mostly helped kid with the skiing.

Notes:

* preparing for Skiing: talk to friends, watch youtube videos. unfortunately, nothing can prepare you for actual experience
* before putting on skiing equipment, eat food/hydrate/freshen up etc. its bloody tedious to unpack yourself and repack. given the clothing layers, skiing equipment etc.
* skiing is essentially, leverage your weight, gravity and your center of mass to push yourself (ski). breaking speed by snow plow(ing). sense of balance is v.v. essential.
* if you are speeding up, do SNOW PLOW.
* if its your first day
        * choose a `green` slope (easiest level).
        * forget about turns, simply ski down
        * you WILL fall down. It is essential to get up. Make sure you are prepared for it, as much as you can. I fell down 15 times, during first two lifts.
        * wasnt able to walk on skiis, it is required to board the lift.
        * wasnt able to get off the lifts, always crash landed on the slope.
        * ensure you hold poles correctly, by putting pole grip roundabouts in your wrist. so that whenever you fall down, the poles ll stay with you.
        * learn how to put on skiis and get off it. ensure skiis are put against the slope and you put on the downward ski first. use the poles to hold you steady before you put on your second ski.
        * getting off skis: reach a place where skis are against the slope, use poles to push the heel lock back, to unlock ski boots.
        * dont try to push skiis to the direction you want. try to leverage gravity and snow plow to push you into correct direction.
* you might have better control on one leg (right/left handed). That makes difficult to control speed/direction via the weaker leg.",skiing,1579670329,geekasm,True,2020-01-22,1

Need help with buying new skis!,"I’ve never owned a pair of skis before and am looking to buy my first set. I’m 5’8” and weigh 165 lbs. I’d say I’m around an intermediate-advanced skier with the majority of runs I hit being blacks out west in Tahoe and Colorado. Most of the skiing I do is trying to find powder in between tree lines and occasionally hitting moguls as well. 

I’m looking to get a solid pair of all mountain skis, and so far the ones that I’ve had my eye on the most have been Salomon QST 99’s and the Blizzard Rustlers 10. I’ve demoed the QST 106’s and those were fun but maybe thinking those are a little too wide on the underfoot. I’ve also demoed Icelandic Nomad 105’s (really enjoyed those as well but didn’t feel stable when I was bombing a run), Atomic Chetler 100’s (enjoyed those! Liked how it was easier to initiate turns on those but didn’t feel like they did the greatest in powder) and then atomic vantage 97’s (did not like these, wasn’t sure if they were too heavy or not enough rocker but struggled to make turns on them).

Tips for ski servicing.,"Looking for some tips to servicing my skis, let me put my steps in and please correct me if I'm doing something wrong:

Clean (remove wax etc, I use rubbing alcohol for this)
P-tex
Scrape excess

Grind base edge to 400grit at 1 degree with base grinder
Grind base edge to 800grit at 1 degree with base grinder

Grind side edge to 400grit at 2 degree with edge grinder
grind side edge to 800grit at 2 degree with edge grinder

Wax
Scrape excess with plastic scraper.

These are the steps I run through when servicing my skis, does this seem correct to everyone?

A couple of services ago I accidently used my edge grinder on  the base also but they seem to ski fine now so I assume this has had no adverse effects in the long run when corrected with a base grinder.

Any comments, feedback, or help appreciated. I'm just worried I'm not getting the best performance out of my skis but refuse to go to a shop for some reason...

No boot is narrow enough in the calf?,"So I have Solomon S max 130 boots, which when I got them 2 years ago were the best fitting ones I could find across 3 stores. For reference I'm 6/0, 200 lbs, size 11 shoe, but with stupidly, stupidly narrow feet/legs.  You know how some people can wrap their fingers around their wrist and have them touch? I'm about 4mm away  from being able to do that on my ankle.  My calf is there, but also slim (and most of the muscle is right at or above the top of the boot).  The boost have been great the las ttwo seasons, but I think they may be broken in more now and my feet are moving.  Mostly between the ankle and upper leg, by foot itself feels locked in.  It gets worse through out the day as the liners pack in (intuition liners).  By the end of the day I have the buckles done to their tighest settings  (the upper two, foot buckles are fine) and my upper calf can freely move side to side, front to back in the boot (shin bone probably moving 1-1.5 inches relative to the boot in all directions even though it's making contact on all sides firmly), and the ankle/heel are moving around a bit as well (far worse on the right leg only for some reason).  I will be seeing a fitter soon, but aside from a heel lift and/or some material between the heel and sheel (the C shape thing) is there anyhting I can do about the upper leg fit?

Portillo Questions,"Hey all - we're planning a trip to South America and want to snowboard in Chile/Argentina starting mid-July for a month or two. In general information seems pretty thin, but Portillo has been the most confusing of all, especially with their insane full week pricing model.

Hopefully someone who's been can help answer.

1. Is it worth it to stay at the hotel/hostel, and can non-guests use any of the facilities? We're considering renting a camper van for a good portion of the trip regardless, so we could potentially save a ton by doing day tickets and sleeping in the van down the road.
2. Do they actually stop selling tickets at 450 guests? Aka is it possible they'd turn us away if we're not staying in the hotel/hostel and its booked full? Can't seem to find a definitive answer here, but their website does still list day tickets.
3. How long would you recommend blocking out for Portillo? If there's a big storm coming through we'd obviously either change plans or hunker down to get fresh tracks as soon as it passes.
4. Favorite place(s) you skid/snowboarded in South America? We're also eyeing the tres valles, Nevados de Chillan, Las Leñas, Bariloche, and Cerro Castor.

How to move from beginner to intermediate/advanced skiing,So i just started skiing this season and have pretty much gotten the basics down. I started off doing just green runs and have gotten to the point where I can pretty much do them with my eyes closed. No problems with controlling my speed or stopping. But the few times that i've ventured off onto the blue and red slopes I always feel way out of control and cant seem to be able to stop on a dime at the end of the slope or turn while on the slope to slow myself down and sometimes resorted to just falling down so I dont hurt myself. Some people have told me just to use the pizza method and I can do that no problem and inch my way down but all the other skiers around me aren't doing that and I dont want to just be pizzaing my way down harder slopes. I'd like to be able to do them at a fairly good speed while still feeling under control. Any advice would help. thanks,skiing,1579801425,whatugonnadowhenthey,True,2020-01-23,1

Calves and shin pain...would a boot fit solve this or am I just screwed?,"Ever since I became an adult I've been plagued with terrible shin pain while skiing. It is much much much worse in my left shin than my right, TBH I barely notice anything in my right. It's kind of difficult to localize but I would say it is around the middle of the boot height-wise. My legs are unusual in two ways.

First, as a result (ironically) of a skiing crash when I was a kid, my left leg is 1-2 cm shorter than my right. This leads to an asymmetrical gait when running and my calves also have a slightly asymmetrical muscle distribution.

Second, despite being a pretty normal weight (~160, sometimes below that, at 5'11"") I have been cursed with severe fat guy calves. That is, my ankle and foot are relatively normal-sized for someone my height, maybe even a bit smaller than normal. But my calf diameter at the midpoint of the calf is quite a bit bigger than it would be on a ""normal"" calf. It does make heel raises a breeze but that's about the only benefit tbh. When I use most ski boots, I find that the part of the cavity into which you fit your ankles and calves does not flare out enough for me at the top.

I do ski a bit more in the backseat than I would like, but that never used to be a problem, and besides there are shitloads of skiers skiing  the same terrain as I am way more in the backseat but not developing these problems. Especially given that the pain is almost solely on the left shin, I suspect that it almost certainly has to do with my leg length asymmetry, and probably has something to do with my calves.

Now onto the question: would a boot fit solve this? Are there boots out there that have a better profile for the lower leg of someone like me? Would one of those fancy boot fits help with these issues? Or should I just switch to snowboarding (which I've been trying on days when the pain is too bad to ski with limited success)",skiing,1578967360,Meridian17,True,2020-01-13,1

[MOD POST] Please Credit Skiers When Possible,"What’s up /r/skiing 

This is probably long overdue, but there has been a major trend of people taking clips from other sources and posting them here with little to no information.

Now, if you’re posting big name professionals, nobody is going to care.  They have already made it, and a name drop on /r/skiing is going to do close to nothing to their career. On the other hand, if you’re taking a clip from Instagram from some dude that has 100 followers, well, they would probably appreciate being credited to their own skiing when thousands of people are going to see it.    

You still get your karma, and you won’t be fucking some dude out of growing his community that could lead to sponsorships and real revenue.

Of course, there are some people that want to take clips and pass them off as their own to impress a bunch of strangers on the internet.  This works like once.  Redditors have very lives.

Look Pivot vs Tyrolia Attack question for beginner wife.,"Hey all, I am going back and forth and need some help pulling the trigger.  

My wife is a new convert to skiing, but is hooked and progressing fairly quickly.  She is a level 1 maybe 2 skiier 5’3 107 lbs

I bought her a pair of line pandora 84 skis (151) but have yet to purchase bindings for them as she is still on rentals.


I am leaning towards the look pivot 12 which has a minimum din setting of 4.  However the brake size is 95.  I’m curious if that would be too much overhang for 84 skis.  

The other option is the Tyrolia Attack2 13 and they have an 85 brake option.  

I can get either for the same cost to me.

I lean towards the pivot simply because I feel like it could help in the event she fell backwards due to being a beginner and in the process maybe the extra elasticity of the pivot could save her knee.  I realize it’s not a “knee binding” but as she learns I want to prioritize safety since we have kids and aren’t in our 20s anymore.

Let me know your thoughts.  

Does it make sense to prioritize the look pivot in order to have extra knee protection?  At the expense of a 95mm brake on a 84 ski?",skiing,1579021737,mma_newbie,True,2020-01-14,1

So I landed really flat on a small kicker and my heel has been hurting for a week now. Anyone had this before?,"
I was going way to fast I guess and the landing didn’t really hurt. I stomped it, didn’t crash and continued to ski at the local area. I’m guessing the adrenaline kept me from feeling it that day. 

I work in a restaurant and I walk a lot. But I woke up this morning and it still hurts. This happened about ten days ago and I haven’t skied since. (Which is fine by me because there isn’t really any new snow and it’s windy as hell here) 

My thoughts are that my ski boot was too lose and maybe my heel slammed into the bottom of the ski boot creating a bone bruise. 

It’s not a good sore either. It’s a mix of sharp/dull pain. We are planning a trip to JH chasing good snow on the 24th of this month. I still want to ski the local area to keep my skills refined for the trip.

Any tips on skiing after having a broken leg?,"Hi there everyone, I'm brand new to this thread so I apologise if you've seen this question a million times; onwards to the point. 

Tl;Dr at the bottom.

On holiday in Italy, February last year (2019 for those of you finding this post in 100 years and asking the same question 😂) on Valentine's Day of all days, I fell quite severely, one of my skis came off and the other didn't so -I apologise for the graphic nature of this next sentence-  my left leg basically helicopter bladed while falling down the mountain, when I came to a stop my legs were perfectly positioned etc. I was brought to a nearby clinic and yada yada. Once checked out I was informed I had cleanly broken my tibia and my fibula in a straight line, I was put in a cast, no plates or rods just a rock solid full leg cast that changed to a smaller around the break one and then it was taken off, upon return to England I went to the doctor and after about 6/7 weeks I was all clear. The area isn't tender apart from the smallest spot but it's the area my skin and nerves  were trapped against the boot. It makes a loud click every so often but doesn't hurt at all. I've been to plenty of sporting events and regularly put pressure on it during these events. To be honest it feels fine and is perfectly strong. Oh and I forgot to mention, I don't have that sticking out part on the inside of your ankle anymore, not sure if that's supposed to happen but it hasn't caused me any bother. I am going to an indoor slope with ""snow"" this weekend and I'm going on a ski trip soon after that. Should I know anything before I go again due to the break or should I just dive in like I was planning? 

Tl;Dr, I broke my leg and it's all perfectly fine now it's basically bulletproof, any tips for getting back into skiing and should I be worried about anything as I'm an average skier?

I am going skiing again in mid-february, and I assume that these skies are not meant to be stunting with (they are quite heavy and quite rigid). I probably need some twintips, since I have tried going backwards on my current skies and if you look them up you'd understand why they are not ideal for that lol. So it basically boils down to two questions.

\- Will the transition from being a race skier to freestyler be very significent and will it take time for me to get used to it ?

\- What are the right skies for me ? I want to be able to do some difficult slopes, but also hit some jumps once in a while

Advice wanted: How to ski through moguls?,"I'm an intermediate level skier and am pretty comfortable on most blues and groomed black diamond slopes.  However I've encountered moguls on most blacks and many blues, and they've thrown me off every time.  If they're small or the slope is shallow I can ski through them OK, but when they get large or the slope is steep they seem terrifying-- it feels like they constrain my path to the point where I won't be able to slow down as needed.  I find myself constantly stopping and evaluating the easiest path instead of going with the flow, and occasionally I've even just slid down areas on the side of my skis if they seem too hard to handle.

"Sprained my ankle, now my boots are killing me","I sprained my right ankle in pretty badly in a climbing accident last year, and now my ski boots are causing me a lot of pain. The injury happened 9-10 months ago and it took me about a month to recover, but since then I haven't noticed any pain or issues climbing and running. Now that it's ski season though, my right boot is killing my ankle. The boots were fine last year and the left side still feels great, so I assume it's related to the injury. The pain is in my ankle and in the back of my foot, above the heel. Also, I noticed I'm not able to flex the boot as much on the injured side. I'm assuming the sprain lowered my ankle flexibility and now I'm in pain because the boot is bending my foot in a way it's not used to. 

Does anyone have suggestions for ankle strengthening/mobility exercises I could do to help loosen up my weak ankle and get it back in good shape? I did a google search, but there are tons of results and I'm not sure which exercises would be the most helpful for my situation. Also, do people think getting an insole for my boot could help?

DIN setting discussion and Question,"Hello all,

On my first time out I test them by slamming  my skis into the snow sideways and slanted (similar angle to a hard carve) they popped off relatively easily.

Going to Stowe for the first time with a group of 6 - trying to plan the must hits so everyone has a great time. Looking for some advice.,"Hi There - 

Myself and 5 friends (early 30s) are going to Stowe next weekend. It seems like mother nature is finally shaping up and we'll have snow making weather straight between now and then - with some natural snow mixed in as well.

Our group consists of:

* 2 people who you can consider advanced, moving into the expert category. One used to be PSIA I certified and the other was born with skis on his feet. They'll ski the double blacks at smuggs, okemo, and will hike when we go out west to Alta, Snowbird, etc.
* 2 people in the group are upper intermediate. Ski 50% blues and 50% single blacks depending where we are (Okemo, Sunapee, Wildcat). These guys can definitely do harder trails and it's a mental game for them - so any suggestions on confidence building diamonds would be awesome.
* 2 people in the group are solid intermediates. They only ski blues and are intimidated by blacks - but they can absolutely ski blacks if they got over the mental barrier so again, looking for some confidence building trails.


I'm also curious to hear about some of the side country trails. I understand there is some stuff to skiers left off the gondola? After hearing what happened in idaho the other week we may skip out on this since no one has a beacon yet (avy training later this season though - so soon!).

If anyone has trail suggestions that will let our group ski together but also let some people break away briefly to get their dopamine fill that would be very helpful! 

I am personally in the second group. I picked up skiing last year after a 10 year hiatus and am back on diamonds after taking 2 lessons last season and getting out about 12 times between march last year and now (5 being this season). Ready to really kick it up a notch.

Planning a Trip for Late March,"Hey Everyone,

Looking to get some advice for an end of season ski trip with some friends. We are currently deciding between steamboat and salt lake. The week is March 27th-April 5th.  As it stands we are looking for the least expensive option. Flying in to both areas is about the same price. However, I will have a free place to stay in downtown salt lake.

First Ski Purchase for a beginner? Liberty Variant80Ws,"It's my first season, but I've really fallen for skiing. I wasn't actively shopping for skis but came across a pair of Liberty 2019 Variant 80Ws a couple of cm longer than my current n00b season rentals for $150 new or 2019 Variant 87Ws for just slightly more.

Women’s touring boots in 21/21.5,"So my girlfriend has childlike feet. Tiny. She’s a mondo size 21.5 in Tecnica and Dalbello and probably most other brands. She’s looking to purchase a crossover touring boot for resort and backcountry skiing. With dynafit inserts.

Any guides/advice on fitting my own boot?,"I went to the only boot-fitting store in town today, looking for a touring boot and they didn't have my size in stock. There are two other outdoors stores which stock a larger range but they don't offer custom boot fitting services. There is also another store located in the town close to the resort but their prices are really steep. As of right now the best option seems to be fitting myself at one of the outdoors retailers in combination with researching each specific model I'm interested in online and then getting the original boot-fitter to customise them, e.g. footbeds and liners heat moulded.

I was wondering what I should be looking for when deciding if a boot fits me well.",skiing,1579177709,Chvrche5,True,2020-01-16,1
Understanding unintended binding release,"I was skiing yesterday and today, on different skis (rentals) and in somewhat different snow conditions. Yesterday everything was fine, today the skis behaved very problematically - twice my bindings had an unintended release, after which I called it a day because I didn't feel safe.

Yesterday: Rossignol Hero Elite Multi Turn which are marketed mainly for going fast on slopes. Very good fresh groomed snow, not too stiff; but they did well on moguls and on slightly icy off-piste too. When braking at high enough speed (maybe 40-50kph?) or on a steep slope, the skis would rattle for maybe half a second but brake fine.

Today: Rossignol Experience 84ai, marketed as all-mountain. It was a few degrees colder, much stiffer snow. Braking at the same speeds on the same slopes as yesterday took much longer, the skis rattled much longer (2+ seconds) and stronger, and in two cases one of the skis flew off during the brake.

So there's multiple factors at play here - different ski type, different bindings, different weather. Could people help me understand what's the most likely explanation for what happened? E.g.:

- A lot of vibration during braking is not normal, right? I never felt that before.
- Is vibration likely to make a binding release easier than it normally would? I.e. should I develop a reflex ""if it vibrates, better get ready for a potential release""?
- Is it just a bad idea to go even 50kph on a groomed slope on this type of ski?

Sadly, cross-country skis cannot be used in snow kiting, as  you're constantly turned 90-45 degrees to one side, and you'd turn your skis as you're pulled.

Cross Country Skiing for work,"Hey y'all,

I'm looking at getting a pair of xcountry skiis for work. I do forestry work in the upper Midwest and am currently doing work on a very large area chock full of logging trails that are always open and clear. Think ungroomed snowmobile trails. 

Currently I've found that Nordic touring skis are the best bet for me as I would be on mainly ungroomed trails.

I'm debating between metal edged vs non and trying to find a good boot.

My preference for boots would be to have one pair I could wear all day, skiing to my plots deep in the woods and walking around on the plots. These plots can be in wet areas like swamps so I'm looking at something with a higher top, mid calf to knee high like muck boots. Waterproof and insulated as well. That way I don't have to drag more gear than necessary into the woods. Any ideas?

Powder skiing aside, can someone that has skied both types of terrain answer a few questions:

1. Of course, different strokes for different folks, but how is wide open skiing compared to thin trails? To me, it looks *bleh*.

Ever played the One-piece game?,"This game was first introduced to me during my years at the University of Denver (2008). We would ski/snowboard 60-80 days a season, if not more, and always play the one-piece game at varying levels of intensity. 

The rules are quite simple. As you ski for the day with your group, each person competes against each other to accumulate as many points as possible. 

One point is awarded when you make physical contact with another skier who is wearing a one-piece ski suit. This can be as simple as tapping their skis with your poles to getting a high-five. A point is only awarded if another member of your group sees the contact. A one-piece wearing skier can only be tapped once. 

The person with the most points at the end of the day gets their drinks picked up by the rest of the group or a similar award. 

Has anyone played this game before? The person who originally taught me to play as a skier from SF. Never heard of anyone else playing this though. Would be interested to hear if anyone else has played.",skiing,1578523024,winnwashere,True,2020-01-08,1
Terrifying Account of the In-Bounds Avalanche at Silver Mt. Idaho,"01/07/2020

Personal Summery by Bill Fuzak

Avalanche burial at Silver Mountain Ski Area / Wardner Traverse / 16 to 1 run

On Tuesday Jan 7, 2020 around 11 AM I was involved in and consequently fully buried for approximately 50 minutes in an inbounds avalanche at Silver Mountain Ski and Snowboard Park. The avalanche occurred in a recently opened part of the ski area where over 20 inches of new snow had fallen in two days.

I was part of a group of 10+ skiers and boarders that had entered the Wardner Traverse area and started setting a ski packed path on the Traverse. We had been waiting for the rope to drop for the area and entered the traverse only after the closed sign had been removed and with a Silver Mountain Ski Patrol member giving the verbal ok to “start cutting the traverse ourselves or wait for a Ski Patroller to break trail on the traverse”. I personally heard the conversation with the 3 lead skiers and the patroller as I was the 4th person going out onto the newly cut traverse. Our understanding was avalanche mitigation with explosive charges had been completed off the top of Wardner Peak before skiers and boarders entered the then uncut traverse.

The going was slow and all but 6 or 7 riders of the original group dropped into glades prior to reaching the run named 16 to 1. The three lead skiers dropped in to ski the fresh snow about a third of the way across 16 to1. The rest of us, appx 4 or 5 people, dropped in closer to the tree edge. After only one or two turns the snow started to fracture above us as well as below us and the slide started to propagate and accelerate. I heard a female voice over my right shoulder, I think it was Rebecca, say calmly that “it’s giving way, try to stay on top”. I lost my left ski almost immediately and fell backwards while trying to release my right ski to no avail. A few seconds later while swimming to try and stay on top of the slide it slowed and pulled me down completely under the snow. As the moving snow ground to a halt and compressed around me I started punching upwards with my right fist to create an air hole above me. I was able to successfully reach the surface with my right fist and then started creating space around my mouth and face to get air. When I had air flowing unobstructed into the hole I had created I started waving my gloved hand out the air hole hoping someone would see me. I also shouted for help for several seconds before calming down. I was glad to have air and thought I had a good chance to be rescued.


Within seconds, another, more powerful slide hit and buried my breathing hole under what felt like feet of snow. I heard and felt the snow compress around me and I was unable to move anything but my right hand to clear my face and mouth. At this point I tried to calm my breathing and conserve air. I don’t know how long I stayed conscious after that. I had already relegated myself to the inevitable as I knew the air would not last long. I was in no pain and knew I wasn’t injured. I’m really surprised how calm I felt but knew there was nothing I could do but wait and pray.


The first thing I remember when coming back to consciousness was a group of rescuers cheering that a survivor had been located, me. I cannot express the surprise and relief I felt to hear and see other people digging me out. Ski patroller Bill held my hand and helped keep me calm as he and the others helped dig me out as I was buried upright in the deep snow. Apparently, my lips were blue when they unburied me and I was initially unconscious. My hands and feet were extremely cold but I was uninjured, breathing and moving well. I was elated to still be “here”. I was more than ready to get out of my encasement, afraid that a 3rd slide would bury me again. Bill asked me about other members of the party I was aware of. I thought there were at least 3 others buried in my general vicinity. I believe Ski Patroller Maya Pardue found me with her probe then other volunteers came over to help dig me out. Maya, thanks for sticking to it, finding me and consequently saving my life. I am eternally grateful to you and your group of patrollers.


During and after extrication Patroller Bill checked me over and concluded I was not severely injured. I was able to walk and with help load into a toboggan attached to a snowmobile. A snowmobile driver and Ski Patroller Bill transported me down to the snow cat maintenance facility to be checked out by local medical professionals and warmed up. I sat with and spoke with another rescued local skier named Ken who had also been buried for 50 minutes. He also survived by creating an air space and through the incredible efforts of Ski Patrol and other volunteers on scene. I was interviewed extensively by the Sheriff as well as the head of Silver Mountain Ski Patrol in the Ski patrol office.
I cannot give enough thanks and compliments for the effort shown by the Silver Mountain Ski Patrol, Search and Rescue volunteers as well as other skiers and riders that played a role in saving my life and the other riders lives. My family especially wants to thank them all for saving us. My heart goes out to the families of the two riders that did not survive.

Sincerely,

I’m bringing a pair of Rossi exp 88’s with me which I figure will cover most of the mountain. Am I going to sink if they get a lot of snow? Any fun trees on the mountain I should be looking for?

Thanks everyone. I don’t know what I don’t know at this point, so fire away.",skiing,1578590108,Indica1127,True,2020-01-09,1
"Tips for Keystone, Breck and A Basin Trip",So myself and a buddy are going to the 3 aforementioned resorts in about 2 weeks - we are both intermediates.  We’ve skied Keystone once before and stuck mostly to blues and greens. We’ve also skied Killington and Whiteface out in our native east coast. We generally ski at Holiday Valley as we from Buffalo and have no problem with any of the hills there lol. I’m a little curious what to expect for bowl skiing and black diamonds out in these 3 resorts. Is it something we should be able to handle?

PSA: Do NOT attempt trails you aren’t ready for,"A week ago, I was skiing on a flat byway to get to the backside of the mountain I was skiing at. A lot of trails merge with this byway, so you have to be vigilant and make sure you don’t crash into anyone else.

I was going maybe 15 mph, when I was hit by what felt like a semi truck from behind. I hit the ground, hard, and couldn’t move. I passed out and woke up in the ER an hour later. I have a severe concussion, a spinal injury, and a black and blue jaw. 

According to snow patrol, the skier that hit me was a 250 lb novice skier from Texas, more than double my weight, and going at least twice as fast as me. She attempted a double black tree run, shot out the bottom, and hit me going at least 30 mph. Moral of the story is, don’t attempt trails you know you aren’t ready for! This was her first day ever skiing, and she had no business attempting a double black. Not only could you injure yourself, but you could also injure others. Because of her careless actions, I’m missing out on the rest of the season.",skiing,1578591192,kaceyeeyee,True,2020-01-09,1
Scottish Skiing (Glencoe/Glenshee),"Wondering if anyone in this group has been to the Glencoe or Glenshee areas to ski in Scotland and their thoughts? 

I'm a student living in Glasgow so just found myself with not enough money for a full ski trip this year. Only ever skied abroad and now that I'm of an age where I have my own car and own responsibilities etc. been toying with the idea of heading up there if it's worth it. 

My dad used to go ski with his friends there all the time when he was my age and I'm now seeing a fair few I used to know from school heading up so been thinking it must be decent enough.

Any knowledge of anything about the two areas (conditions, worth the price etc.) would be greatly appreciated. Thought this post would be a good idea before taking the 2hr drive. Or if anyone would advise I just stick to my local indoor slope that's only around 15 mins away.

Ducking Fences In Avalanche Zones,"I wanted to share what I saw in Whistler Blackcomb yesterday (on Blackcomb Mountain, specifically). 

WB has gotten a ton of snow in the last week, ~60”, and this combined with a persistent weak layer in the snowpack means that ski patrol has their hands full with avalanche control. Much of the alpine hasn’t opened all season, and everyone is chomping at the bit to get out there. Some people are a little too excited. 

There’s a large bowl called Lakeside Bowl that has been closed all season because of the slide risk. There’s a big sign by the lift that says it’s closed due to avalanche danger, and the entire run is roped off with a bunch of “Closed for Avalanche Risk” signs. They even stuck a patroller up there to yell at people to try to keep them out. Unfortunately, I watched about 10 people evade the patroller and duck the fence a few meters lower, endangering not only themselves but all the people on the open runs below this bowl (where I was standing).

Since they couldn’t control people ducking the fence, ski patrol shut down the entire 7th Heaven lift servicing the area. So one of the few alpine areas with tons of terrain was closed for the rest of the day because a few jackasses couldn’t keep out of the one far bowl. 

Maybe you don’t understand the risks, maybe you just aren’t thinking at all. But ski patrol isn’t just a bunch of party poopers. If it says it’s closed for avalanche risk stay out. You’re not only endangering yourself but others below you and those who will try to dig you out. Stay safe out there.",skiing,1578608053,piepiepie31459,True,2020-01-09,1

A friendly reminder not to trespass onto empty racing slopes and snow parks ;),"If you see an empty groomed, piste with red and blue poles/gates on it, please, please, please do not EVER go on it, even if it's seemingly open and unused or only being used on one side/bit of the piste. However enticing it may seem, and I know how enticing it is. It is downright dangerous, you probably will not hear the 18 year old, semi conscious, half asleep jackass surviving on red bull and milka bars skiing a complicated slalom or GS course in between 20-40mph. By the time you hear us shout at you to get out of the way it is probably too late and it is up to us to bail, which is not always possible. 

If you see a seemingly empty race track with the gate left semi open you know better than to go and have a spin on it on your own. If you want to race, AWESOME, start doing local races, take a ski school camp, join a club and go from there, but please, please, please, don't trespass ski racing pistes, not only will you get shouted at you will be putting yourself and people training at a huge risk of crashing and knee injuries that you don't want to begin to imagine. 

A. Coaches will berate you for going on the piste

B. When coach is not looking we will berate you harder

C. Ski Patrollers will anally rape you 

Also if you or your friends are the type to do this, you're (most likely) not good enough to navigate a course of 50 complex gates in an expedient fashion. Same for 'I was only on the side'. When we crash, we slide a loooooong way before stopping. And when we're sliding on our backs with 2 legs in the air with 1 ski on, we generally don't give a shit about what's in front of us cus it's too late. We just brace ourselves and hope for the best. 

Same goes for most snow parks. Stick to stuff adapted to your level, NEVER stop below a jump, NEVER cross a snow park. This happened to a friend of mine who's an accomplished park skier and racer and nearly ***DECAPITATED*** someone who was crossing the snow park under the landing in the blind spot you only see in the air. Luckily no one got hurt, but I've never screamed to move out of way louder in my life.

Windshield ice accumulation when driving [to/from the mountain] in heavy snow: How do you prevent it?,"I know this is slightly off topic to skiing, but since most of us flock to (rather than avoid) driving in snowstorms I figured there'd be some opinions on this.  

I've noticed that if I drive with the defroster fan and heat cranked all the way, snow melts to my windshield and then refreezes to my wipers (and the parts of the windshield further away from the defroster vents) as more snow accumulates.  This happens even with winter blades.  

If I am driving at a decent speed (&gt; 30 mph), I've found that turning down the heat and fan on my defroster will let the snow blow off my windshield without sticking.  But if I'm driving slower, the snow sticks to my windshield (With less wind to blow it off) and i then get the melting / icing.  

Does anyone have method that they find prevents icing the best?",skiing,1578680897,aestival,True,2020-01-10,1
[buying advice]Need advice on new skis,"
Hello,

I am currently looking to buy my first new pair of skis and can’t decide between 5 models. 
1. Atomic Redster X5
2. Atomic Vantage 75C
3. Atomic Vantage 79C
4. Atomic Punx 5
5. Salomon X Max X12

All the above mentioned skis are now between 250 and 350 euros. 

I mainly ski on piste in Austria but enjoy the occasional off-piste run. Every year I spend about a week on piste with skiers where I try to keep up with cheap rented skis and aprox. 2 days with snowboarders off-piste. My skill level is currently advanced and I mostly enjoy fast short/mid turns, but also have a lot of fun skiing off-piste. 

I can’t decide whether I should buy the Redster or the X Max to have fun while skiing on piste and borrow/rent skis for off-piste, the Vantage 75c or 79c to use them throughout the season on every occasion, or buy the punx and hope they cope well on piste with my skier friends using slalom skis. 

Any recommendation/suggestion on what I should buy is greatly appreciated. Also, do you think twin tips like the Punx 5 are any good for carving on piste?

Thank you!",skiing,1578681823,lixxers,True,2020-01-10,1

Went skiing solo for the first time yesterday!,"For background, my mom had me on a pair of skis as soon as I could walk and I've been skiing every season ever since. I'm 19 now. Anytime we've gone on any trips whether they were big or small, it was always just me and my mom or my mom and I with a group of friends.

Well she now works about an hour from seven springs in PA and a few days ago she said ""hey, why don't you bring your gear, come with me to work, take the car and go to seven springs and just pick me up when I get off work"" now how could I ever say no to that?

I had an absolute blast and it felt so good to just do whatever I want whenever I wanted and just have that sense of freedom. And sure I love going with groups but it was just really cool to go alone for once. I loved it.

A little help with flat feet and boot rentals for a first timer?,"Sorry for the noob question.  I’m from Hawaii and have never been on skis in my life.  I’m going on a ski trip to Whistler this spring break.  

I’m really looking forward to the trip but I’m concerned it’s going to be very painful because my feet are pronated.  When I rollerblade or ice skate, I get really bad cramps/aching in my arch and usually large blisters as well.  

I’ve seen the consensus advice is to see a boot fitter which makes a lot of sense.  However, I’d like to avoid purchasing boots as I’m not sure I’ll use them again and the trip is already very expensive with airfare, hotel, lessons, lift tickets, rental gear for etc for the whole family.  If I or my family love skiing, I’d definitely consider it for the future.    

My plan is to rent boots along with the rest of the gear and look into getting some inserts or foot beds to put in.  Does that sound viable?  Is there another option I could look into?  Are the fittings for rental boots adequate enough that I won’t spend the trip in pain?

I saw that snowboarding might be a better option but the rest of my family and our friends are all doing ski lessons together.

"Emotionally dealing with seeing a devastating injury, and a compliment to bravery","I have to vent a bit, folks, then hopefully you guys can offer some support or insight. Today I happened upon a serious accident right after it happened (I didn't witness). I did the responsible thing and set up skis in an X and made sure patrol was alerted. The injured person was maybe college aged and definitely had a head injury. She was obviously in a ton of pain and terrified / crying. Instinct took over and I got down to get her talking and make sure she didn't move until medics arrived. The only witness was a girl who was maybe 12 (plus the other person involved in the collision who was uninjured).

I'm an instructor (I wasn't working or even at my home hill today...just enjoying a day with the fam) and so I know how medical incidents work. I knew that the injured person was about to be loaded onto a backboard and a collar and rushed to the ER. I knew the person that ran her over was going to be questioned extensively. I knew the young eyewitness was completely destroyed, like seeing a horror movie when you're too young, and the absolute last thing she wanted to do was talk about it.

I introduced myself to them and volunteered to ski down to the safety office and stay with them throughout, and they took me up on it. There wasn't much I could do other than sit there with them and occasionally offer a hand squeeze, but I tried.

I'm amazed how brave these 3 young women were. The injured person did everything patrol asked of her. She even asked the EMTs to wait so her friend could go get her ID and insurance card! Total champ. The person who collided with her didn't hit and run. Despite her distress, she stayed. When I skied up and seemed to know what I was doing, she immediately started recounting the incident to help me control the scene until medics got there. She stuck around for everything and didn't hit and run like so many people do. When it was the young girl's turn to talk she stood up, wiped every tear away, and marched in to talk to the patroller with her head high.

What I'm dealing with now is that my confidence is destroyed. I have barely been able to talk all evening. I'm supposed to be back out there tomorrow but I don't want to. Every time I see an injury it crushes my mojo for awhile and I just want to take up bingo as my new hobby. How do you guys deal with that?",skiing,1578793496,igotmyliverpierced,True,2020-01-11,1

Got some work done on my skis this season and now they ski funny. Is it me or the skis? (its probably me),"Thanks for reading this post, hopefully what I'm asking makes sense. This is my second season skiing seriously, bought these second hand last year at the beginning of the season: https://www.ski-review.com/ski_reviews/review/blizzard_s_power_fs_2016/.  I am 5'4"" and about 140 lbs.  I wanted carving skis as I almost exclusively ski groomers on the east coast.  When I bought the skis the local shop did a tune up and waxing which I used for the rest of the season.

This year I decided to try the phantom wax on my skis and I felt last I wanted a little more hold on my edges while carving so I asked my shop to sharpen the edges.  To do the phantom wax they also did a base grind.

The first day taking my skis redone was wild!  I had barely any control and was sliding all over the place.  My edges also felt really weird, not catching but felt like they were carving funny.  Spent most of the day skid skiing down the hill.

After a few more days on the skis I find they are much better, I can carve all my typical blue hills but I am still struggling to carve on  some blacks I could carve last year.  The edges hold a lot firmer through my carving turns but I find it much more difficult to slow down with skidding turns - the ski edges seem to ""catch"" and suddenly instead of skidding through the turn I'm suddenly shooting down the hill on the edges.  The other weird change is my skis seem a lot harder to stop with the parallel or ""hockey"" stop.  I seem to end up over turning and end up backwards, or can't seem to generate nearly as much stopping force.

So my question is if its the skis or is it just me?  Do I need my edges de-tuned?  Contemplating taking some private lessons to clean up my technique as well.",skiing,1578798820,Vidaria,True,2020-01-11,1

"[Question] Just went skiing for the first time. My skis were super heavy, and I couldn't lift them to turn properly. Is this normal?","Hey, guys. I went skiing today and I had fun, but I was frustrated because picking up my skis while riding felt impossible. I figure that skis are probably meant to be heavy, but I mean...I could not pick them up in order to make sharper turns at all. I feel like they were too long, too. I obviously can't expect to be a pro right off the bat, but I really could not lift and turn at all. I saw other people making sharp turns and it seemed as if their skis never lifted from the ground! I'm sure it's because they practice, but I couldn't turn my skis at all!

Is it normal for skis to be extremely heavy or do this sort of thing? I saw younger kids (like maybe 8 years old) turning with no issue, but I was a grown person struggling to make any of it work, constantly on the ground lol.

Are there lighter skis? Were mine potentially too long or heavy?

I skied for the first time and loved it!,"I have lurked on this sub for many months now because it’s my boyfriend’s favorite hobby - he’s really good too as he was an instructor at a mountain in Colorado and underwent rigorous training - however I’d never skied before until yesterday. I’ve loved learning others’ stories on this sub, so I decided to share my first ski experience with this community :)

I grew up in a tropical climate to largely unadventurous parents who instead instilled a fear of falling (and hurting myself) in me from a very young age, and so my entire life I’ve been afraid of ice/snow sports. I recently discovered how much I enjoy hiking but I still can’t get myself to hike/walk in the snow. Anyway, when I met my boyfriend he described skiing to me as one of the most fun yet peaceful and intimate experiences of his life, like meditation. I made up my mind to give it a shot, so he invited me to a ski trip with his friends and offered to teach me. I was so, so nervous the whole time but I’m so glad that I pushed myself to go, and also to get up and try again every single time i fell, which was a lot of times!! It took me almost 1.5 hours to complete my first trail, and I likely fell 20+ times, but it was incredibly enjoyable the whole time! I was laughing every time I fell and I really pushed myself mentally and physically to somewhat overcome my fear of falling. I watched so many adults and little toddlers skiing flawlessly on the same trail and told myself that I could do it too. As I tried harder and practiced more I got a lot better. I learned to properly balance my weight and control my speed which was incredible; I never learned to ride a bike because of aforementioned fear of falling, so watching me being able to balance myself on a moving object made me so, so happy. The progress was so rewarding and it became more and more fun as I started enjoying the speed rather than fearing it. 


I ended up getting only 3 runs in, but my last run I didn’t fall a single time, and finished in 15 min. I was so proud of myself, and sooo grateful for my boyfriend who basically spent his entire day by my side on the easiest trail (he’s always on double blacks), teaching me the right technique, being super patient and not once rushing me, allowing me to take as many breaks as i needed, encouraging and helping me up every time I fell, and also pushing me to try again when I felt like giving up. At the end of the day when we met up with his friends he would not shut up about how proud he was of the progress I’d made :))) Every single muscle in my body is sore right now but I’ve never felt stronger, both physically and mentally.

Rustler 10s For Intermediate to Advanced Skill level? Something else?,"Hey all, I'm in my 3rd year after not skiing for 10 years (skied since 3, but never got really good, just mostly blues with bad technique).  Overall, I'm intermediate, but want to get better.

My first skis 3 years ago when i got back into it were Rossi e77s at 160cm.  I'm 5'8 160lbs, so they are pretty short and narrow with the waist of 77mm.  Poor choice in hindsight.  

My current issues: 

1.  Bumps cause huge stability issues.   I hate being on groomers after lunch, I feel like one small bump is going to end me.
2. Can't go through crud or powder at all (a given, considering the ski).
3. No confidence on blacks.  I always find myself not being able to get into a turn (though this, admittedly, is most likely my horrible technique).  I usually just end up skidding.

I want a ski that's good for both powder and groomers.  I tend to hit Mammoth up during and after storms (backside especially, but right now I can only board on it since my current skis cant deal with pow).  I want something I can grow into, but won't bite me if my technique is still being practiced.  I do like glade runs as well, though they are a challenge for me if the incline is more black than blue.

I've been eyeballing the Rustler 10s, but the more reviews I read on all skis, the more indecisive I get.  I mainly saw them due to some YouTube videos, so I don't want to build a bias because of that.  I'm open to any and all suggestions.

I’ve been using mostly slalom type skis, but I want to try something new as i always venture to parks on the way and like to get air always when there is a chance on a piste. I found the Black Crows Captis which as they say are very universal. What are your thoughts on the skis?

A story about a big day out dealing with avalanches,"Hey. 

It's not often that I tell a story, but I really felt for sharing this one.  Last season we had a big day out in Lyngen alps. After skiing the main objective (Store Lakselvstind N), we decided to head for another couloir to make the way down to the parking lot a little more exciting. In the video you will see what bad decision making can result in, and how we handled it.

Skiing or Snowboarding?,"We are going skiing soon and it will either be for 1 day or 1 1/2 days and I’m trying to decide whether to ski or snowboard. I’ve never done either before and obviously skiing is easier to learn than snowboarding. In the end I plan on learning both but if you had to pick one to learn first, which would it be? I think I want to eventually snowboard but don’t know if it would be worth it to get a snowboard lesson and only have a day or so (especially as miserable as I’ve heard learning to snowboard can be) or if I should just get a ski lesson and have fun for now and learn to snowboard later once I’m competent on skis.",skiing,1578190085,loldude513,True,2020-01-04,1
How to improve carving / keeping safer speeds,"Does anyone have good resources on how to best/learn and improve carving?  Specifically on groomers.  NE skier here.  I’m an intermediate/advanced skier I’d say but feel like I’m skidding more often than actually carving.  I see other advanced skiers doing quick short turns and maintaining a constant speed and feel like I have to work really hard to replicate that.  I usually just opt to bomb down the mountain instead of stressing about it, often hitting arguably dangerous speeds for my skill level (~50-55mph).  I feel pretty comfortable in the moment (and only when Im not close to others) but realize I should probably slow it down and work on form more.  Anyone else have similar struggles?

I’m sure the popular answer is to take a lesson, but with my family life/work schedule I can hardly get to the mountain more than a handful of days in the year.  I’m sure it would be worth the investment but once I get there I just want to go hard and not do a lesson.

Intermediate skier looking for recommendation on next skis to level up with,"Hey r/skiing! Happy to have found this sub! 

I'm looking for some advice on what skis to look into for the future. It's my third season, based in the PNW with some occasional trips to the Kootenays/Rockies. So far I've been using an old pair of used Head M70s, and I've tried a similar beginner rental ski on a trip to Revelstoke. I've started to get into the glades a bit, but finding I'm getting buried in the powder which is making it hard to control the tips through turns. I've been looking online at ""Intermediate"" All Mountain skis and they seem to range from 76 up to 100 cm in width. 

I'm curious as to whether, due to my light weight, I could get away with some shorter or more rockered skis that might help with the tight turns where it matters - but generally looking for a recommendation on the direction to go if I'm looking to generally level up. Something to grow into, or something more forgiving? Definitely something to better handle the powder I keep running into (literally).

Boot Help / Hell / Advice needed,"First thing I’m a snowboarder so know nothing about ski boots this but posting on behalf of my wife. 

So my wife who absolutely loves skiing and moved out west for the big mountain vertical and usually better snow is having a seriously hard time with her first new boots in a while and feels like she will never ski again. 

She’s an ex-racer so following the first set of retail boots in which the fitter didn’t believe she was an aggressive rider and put her in an 80 stiffness boot which she went straight through the front of while riding some epic powder lines last year we ended up getting custom boots fitted with orthotics, custom liners and having the boot cut adjusted. 

The issue now despite having no pressure points in the boot and being in them over an hour in the store twice is in crippling pain when ever we’re out on the mountain with persistent numbness and pain more than she’s had even packing out her race boots.

Poles are completely unnecessary and using them can be detrimental to learners,"Let me start by saying there are pretty much only three main uses for poles.

You can use them to push on flat terrain, which just exhausts your arms and your core and is inferior to just skating around (you can even skate uphill if you're strong enough). Poles can also help you navigate the lift line but you really don't need them for that either.

Pole checks at turns can help you get a feel for your balance, but if you already have your parallel turns down they are still useless. Even the most advanced skiing techniques don't require poles. I'd also point out that relying on your poles as a counterbalance (which I've seen so many people try to justify on this sub) is going to make you a worse skier not a better one. Your body is your source of balance, not your equipment. For this reason I tell every new skier to not use poles. They are a crutch!

Seriously, next time you go to a resort look at everybody with poles. I guarantee MAYBE one out of a hundred people will be making pole checks with their parallel turns. Everyone else just kinda dangles them off to the sides for no reason, or drags them in the snow to try and slow down. I've even seen people break them in half trying to use them to stop during a turn. Totally useless and even if you aren't a beginner, spending a ton of time focusing on and relying on your ""proper pole technique"" is going to take your focus away from developing actual skill.

Lastly, you can use them to get back up on your feet. Once again, helpful if you're a beginner, but if you have built up some leg muscles you should be able to pop up just fine. Getting out of your bindings? Just bend your knees down and pop it out with your hand, then use your other foot to push the back of the other binding down.

I'm convinced there's some vast conspiracy with pole companies to try to make the ""image"" of a ""good skier"" one with poles. I just started skiing without poles this season and I have never felt so free and in control. Poles are nothing but a crutch, and you are limiting your potential as a skier by using them. ESPECIALLY if you are a beginner, poles will teach you to NOT rely on your core and leg muscles for balance and control.

So I guess the question is whether the skis I've chosen are correct for me? Which one is the better option? Thanks!

What do you do when people block the width of the entire trail?,"As you might expect, this past weekend was quite busy. On one particular trail, there is a narrow part at the top where people tend to stop and take pictures before heading down.

On one of my runs, the entire width of the trail was blocked except for a small 2-3 ft window. I was gonna go through there but a snowboarder stopped and blocked it as well.

My options at this point were either to stop and ask/wait for people to move or ski through on 1 ski. Normally I would just go into the trees but it's been pretty dry for the last 3-4 weeks so the coverage is poor.

I went through on 1 ski without bumping into anyone (low speed) but someone made a passing comment to me.

I try to share the mountain, not ski unnecessarily close to others, and avoid weaving but felt like I didn't really have any other option.",skiing,1578335273,jkwah,True,2020-01-06,1
Help buying new skis: Armada Tracer 98 2020,"Hi.

I'm about to buy a new [Armada Tracer 98 2020](https://www.evo.com/skis/armada-tracer-98). They have lengths of: 164, 172, 180, and 188.

My specs:

\- Intermediate skier (working on my form)

\- Been skiing with 169cm length skis (84mm width) for 3 years. I like them but want more advanced skis.

\- 5'11 Male

\- Weigh around 157lbs

\- Ski mostly the north east but I travel west too a handful times a year.

\- I like to ski in a controller and flowing manner. I sometimes ski fast but for the most part I'm slower (by choice) than my friends.

I'm looking to get the 180cm length skis of the Armadas but it can seem too long for me. The 172 feels like a safe bet for me but can also be too short according to some ppl I talked to. Any advice?

Pain with my boots,"Hey guys,
I have a pair of Atomic Hawx prime 100 that I bought in France (a boot fitter made it custom). 
I didn’t go ski last year because of an injure, so I’ve decided to go for a dry run (ski simulator). 
1) I have found out that my left shin really hurts when I flex my leg with the boot (even when no skiing). And I don’t know what do with that.. 
[thus is how I flex and when it hurts the most](https://ibb.co/zRPw1Mh)

2) After I ski for a whole day, my calves are hurt and I don’t understand why because I don’t ski in the backseat and my instructor confirmed that.. 

3) when I skied in the dry run, my left leg front numb after a while.. I’m afraid that maybe the boot pressure against my calves or something? 
[Here are some photos how the boot is on my leg..](https://ibb.co/album/gpGc1F)
sometimes I feel a pressure in the rest circules, maybe it cut off the blood to my leg so it feels numb?

Skiers vs. Snowboarders,"I have a question. I'm a snowboarder and notice that older skiers seem to have some sort of prejudice towards snowboarders, is there any reason for that? For example I've had a skier scream at me because I crashed into him on accident, He was crossing the trail and didn't look up-trail as your supposed to, and i came down and didn't see him and when i did i tried to avoid him and clipped his skis and we both wiped out,I took my board off and went to offer help and ask if he was OK and he was livid and told me that he has a hip problem and i could've hurt him, So i apologized again and he screamed that snowboarders should not be allowed on any mountain. Another experience I had was when I was going ""to fast"" on an empty blue trail, So the snow cops ill call them stopped me and threatened to take my pass because i could've seriously injured someone, I was also Boarding with a friend of mine who was a skier and was going faster than me, I could be wrong but it seemed like I was stopped because i was a boarder and not a skier.

Looking for advice with buying skis!,"Heya folks,

I'm looking to buy my first pair of skis, whilst I'm doing a season in Courchevel in the Alps. I'd originally ordered a pair of 181 Icelantic Nomad 105s, however after 2 weeks of waiting, I've now been told the place I'd bought them from had actually sold out. I've been having difficulty finding them elsewhere in the EU, so if anyone knows somewhere good to get them from, that'd be great too! 

But for now I'm just looking at getting a different pair. I'd tried a friends Nomad 95s, and I loved the feel of them, just wanted something a bit wider.

I'm quite an aggressive skier, and I enjoy off-piste/powder the most (duh), but being realistic probably 70% of my skiing is on pistes. I'd ideally like something that's pretty versatile, with a pretty good balance of fun and stiffness. I do ski quite quickly, so probably slightly on the stiffer side. I'd also *really* like twin-tips, or at least semi-twins, as I do a bit of park and switch skiing. 

I'm Male, ~75kg and ~170cm, maybe a lil bit taller.

I'll be spending the next few days just researching hundreds of skis anyway, but I'd love some recommendations from all you more knowledgeable folk!

Thanks very much :)",skiing,1578343288,QuasiBonsaii,True,2020-01-06,1

Does anyone else not like their Shift bindings?,"This is my second season on my Shifts.  I ski about 30-40 days a year primarily in the resort with a little bit of touring.  I have two setups a 116 underfoot ski with shifts and a 108 underfoot ski with kingpin 10s.  I'd say I have roughly 90 days on the kingpins and roughly 30 days on the shifts and I ski both at a DIN of 9.  I have absolutely zero complaints about my kingpins but there's some things that annoy me with the Shifts.

Everyone has talked about the AFD plate already and I've experienced issues with that as well.  I guess my biggest complaint is that I don't trust the heel piece.  

I use Mtn Lab boots with both bindings.  If my heel isn't perfectly centered when im clicking with the Shifts its possible for my heels to snap over the wings on the heel and not engage the plastic prongs that actually engage the heel piece.  There's been times I hear the snap and think I'm good but my boot is just jammed past the wings and the heel never engaged. This is especially annoying when on steeper terrain and its not always easy to get centered when stepping down. Here's a picture:  [https://imgur.com/a/BOQu4kt](https://imgur.com/a/BOQu4kt)  If it happens I have to unjam my boot and try again.

Another problem is the heel elasticity is real jerky.  I've tested both bindings heel retention by flexing my weight on the front tips of my skis, kind of like a nose butter but not moving.  If I watch my heels the kingpin's elasticity is smooth and I stay in the binding.  When I do the same with the shifts I pop out and fall on my face.  If i look at my heels and what the binding is doing the first part of the elasticity is smooth but kind of stops.  Eventually you hear a pop and the heel will show a little more elasticity.  Push it further and you eject.  While actually skiing there have been times where my weight gets pushed forward and I've prereleased at the heels where I know the kingpins would have held. This is made worse if there is any amount of snow between the heel of the boot and the heel piece, but again I have never had to worry about this with the kingpins. 

Am I the only one to experience these issues?",skiing,1578351599,Vert_n_Dirt,True,2020-01-06,1
Look for advice on skiing,"So I have gone skiing about once a year for 7 years, but still struggle with many things. In a couple of weeks will be my last ski session for a while, so I was trying to get way more comfortable with skiing. For reference, I have done a double black at Jack Frost(which I have heard is like a blue at a hard ski resort, idk), but kinda bs'd it. On that note:

1. The main thing I struggle with is turning to control speed. I am only able to turn my downhill leg(so when I am turning left, only my right leg turns, while my other leg remains mostly straight), making controlling my speed very difficult. How can I learn to do a full turn so I can control my speed
2. On that note, what are some ways to stay in control when I pick up speed. I often feel that when I pick up a lot of speed, I start wobbling and my skis start coming off the ground a bit and I kinda panic and fall. What are some tips to stay in control while I ski? Although I want to learn how to control my speed, I want to be able to pick up a decent amount of speed for fun.
3. Going off my first point, at the end of the turn(when you reach the end of the slope and need to change direction), you have to do a full 180, which I struggle with and end up losing it half way with both my skis point straight down, how do I force the full 180?",skiing,1578354972,throwaway246801234,True,2020-01-06,1

Learning backflips at age 31 - Progression and tips,"I think we can all agree that seeing someone casually throw a laid out backflip is still one of the best sights in the resort.

It's been my skiing dream since I was 8 but I never committed to learning or even attempting. In fact, I never committed to improving, because skiing was already so much fun. 

I finally strapped on a set and told myself that if I didn't learn AND land one this season I'd donate 500 euros to charity. 

Learning from scratch, over two days. Honestly there is nothing more satisfying  than committing to learn something that scares you and stomping it. I would say I totalled about 6-7 attempts before I started landing them. They are WAY easier than 360s in my opinion. I must have landed 20 3's in the past two years and not a single one looked good.

[https://streamable.com/4d5wy](https://streamable.com/4d5wy)

Tips that worked for me:

1. Don't be afraid to ask your friends to record you and study the footage, STRAIGHT AWAY. I quickly identified what I was doing wrong by dissecting every frame. Initially my friend though I was vain but he quickly realised something was up when I started landing them and he was still psyching himself up to try it for the first time.
2. Bigger slightly flatter jump is better than small, super poppy kicker. I wanted airtime.  I'd rather go a bit bigger and stomp it than do a little hucked backflip and then have to learn how to to proper layed out ones further down the line. This one is probably personal choice.
3. As you can see from the video, the first tries where quite 'huck and pray'. Those got me comfortable being upside down. I watched the recordings, and started to focus on upper body rather than thinking about 'backflips'. Pop off the jump, explode with the hips, and roll your eyes/head back exorcist style. Legs tended to follow instinctively when I saw the landing coming up. So what worked for me was to forget about my legs and let my hips and head direct the show. 
4. Arms out to the side once you pop. Not only does it look great, it helps maintain balance (i think).
5. The main thing is the first jump. Think about all the times you ate shit. This is no different, IF YOU ARE DOING IT IN POWDER.  7/8 times I OVER ROTATED, so it was nothing more than a backslap and wipe out. Just grow those cojones, and go for it. Once you've  done one flip, even if you bail, the fear reduces by 50% on the next one. Once you point your skis towards the jump, commit. 

Thanks to all the redditors who helped reviewed my first attempt, and to u/StompItTutorials. That channel has made me a better skier and I highly recommend the youtube channel, whatever your level is you will find something that will help.",skiing,1578356988,Styropian,True,2020-01-06,1
Thoughts on Amazon ski goggles?,"I need to buy new goggles after realizing how awful are my very cheap ski goggles that I've been using for the past 10 years. 

So I want new googles but I also have a tight budget, I don't think I'd be able to buy anything over $50. That being said, Amazon has some decent looking goggles for sale at a decent price. I've seen the Zionor ones, the X4 looks cool enough but I'm really not sure what do I want.

I have no idea how lenses work, etc. I just know that I want as less fog as possible and also preferably no change in color (clear lenses) because I often do (but not always) night skiing. Note: I've seen Zionor googles on sale that are ""clear"", which means there's no change in light. This is great for night skiing, but it bad for day skiing? Another important thing is that sometimes when I remove my goggles they frost a lot. I wouldn't want that to happen.

Why am I so bored while skiing?,"I'm 26 female, been skiing since I was 5.

My husband loves it, my brother loves it and my dad loves it. I'm trying so hard to love it but I feel so blahhh and empty everytime.

How is sliding down and turning once in a while fun? I literally feel like I could fall asleep.

I can compare the feeling of skiing to driving a car, like it's so no brainier and not hard.

There's no challenge. I've skied trails that say ""you could die ski at own risk"" or ""experts only"" and guess what? Bored!!!

Boot advice needed. I have been wearing boots that are two sizes too big for me for 10 plus years…,"I have been skiing for 20 plus years mostly in Minnesota, but have been out to Colorado and the PNW many times. I can handle almost all of the extreme terrain the mountains have to offer including double blacks, backcountry powder, tree skiing, terrain parks and am very confident in my capabilities. However, as I was helping my younger brother go through the process of buying new skis and boots I just discovered that I have been wearing boots that are two sizes too big. I wear a size 9.5 shoe and the fitter suggested I get a boot with mando size 27 and all the ski size charts I have seen confirm this. But I have been wearing a mando size 29 for the past 10 years! I have always noticed a little wiggle room in my boots but never thought much of it. I have also never experienced feet pain/coldness even after a long day of skiing which is nice.


This winter I am going to Steamboat and Jackson Hole and am now considering buying new boots before my trips. Does anyone have experience skiing in boots that are too big for them as well as boots that have a proper performance fit? Would it be worth it to buy a new set of properly fitting boots? Or will I spend the majority of my time on the mountains in pain while the boots take time to form to me feet? Will I notice a large bump up in performance? Is there a whole level of skiing that I am missing out on without having the right size boots? I recently started to try some nose butters and am finding it impossible to do because my heals lift up off the sole of my boot even when the boot latches are as tight as they get.

Intermediate skiier going to Big Sky in Feb/March planning to attempt Liberty Bowl. What should I focus on improving over the next few months?,"Hi all,

Little backstory. East coaster, grew up skiing (6 - 16) mountains like Cranmore, Loon, Sunday River, etc and could tackle most things outside of double blacks (could *get down* but that's it) and moguls at speed. When I turned 16 I swapped to snowboarding until I was 19ish and then kinda stopped until a couple years ago at 28. Picked up snowboarding again, took a nasty fall and swapped back to skiing.

Basically, I have experience but I'm much heavier and older and 10 years out of practice. I skiied in Aspen for a week last year and did fine enough but I think I only attempted one black. First time out west and the length of trails wore me out. 

I mostly stick to blues and have been working over a bit of a speed phobia. I definitely plan to take lessons again to help improve again more quickly.

Anyone got any tips on specific things to practice to tackle liberty bowl as someone who's not super great at steep or fast trails?

"Turns not clicking, trouble with getting pressure on tongue of boot","Beginning level skier working with an instructor. My major issue holding me back is I tend to ski backseat. I can feel my back tips dig into the snow, creating an ugly turn.

Are you putting shin pressure on only one foot? (the downhill foot)?

Skiing Switch on Partial Twin Tips,"I was curious to know what are people’s experience with riding switch with partial twin tips?  I recently purchased my first pair of all mountain skis.

The tail rocker is long but subtle so that it helps with carving.  Personally, I’ve been using Line Afterbangs mounted true center for a long time, which are true twin tips.  However, I never ski park anymore which is why I went with this new pair.  I really enjoy charging down runs and doing small jumps along the sides of groomers, but want to venture a bit more into powder runs too.  Would I have issues riding switch on groomers or landing off of small jumps?

Someone might be wondering why I didn’t go with a model like the Sevrin which is more like the Black Crow Camox.  I’m really more interested in being able to charge runs still, but I do like to occasionally riding switch casually when I’m with some slower friends.

Sense the site just launched we are still making some adjustments and expanding. Right now we are just in Colorado and expanding soon. We hope to not just make it our dream snow tracker but yours too. If you have any feedback let us know.

Liftty Ticket Hack for Big Sky Mt.?,"Hey friends!

Just trying to hack the process a bit on lift prices. Got 5 of us going for 3 days - 15 tickets.

Gave Big Sky group sales a call but that's 25 or more.

Then talked to someone else about buying a 7of9 day pass and a 6of8 day pass to use for all of use over the course of 3 days -  that also got shot down which sucks - $120pd/pp vs $80pd/pp. 

Obviously they recommended just buying sooner than later. 

You guys have any ideas for Big Sky? I know places like SLC used to have killer deals at ski shops at the bottom of the little and big cottonwoods. Anything similar in Bozeman or surrounding?

Tips on advanced intermediate runs at Alta?,"My 11 year old son and I are taking a guys trip to Alta on January 10-14.

We live in Texas so don’t get to ski much, but my son LOVES skiing so this is the first of two trips this year. He has only skied twice but he’s really hardcore and wants to ski everything, and last March we ended up skiing all the blues and a few blacks.

Alta doesn’t distinguish between double and single blacks, and in general it is often hard to know if it is an “easier” black or if you’re going to be falling off a cliff. 

My son loves the adventurous stuff - trees and off-piste, natural pipes, rocks, etc, but obviously I have to reign him in so we don’t both get in trouble.

We’ll start the trip with the greens and the obvious blue cruisers, and will plan to do all the blues, but any suggestions on some of the more manageable blacks at Alta, and any fun off-piste that won’t get us in trouble?  Or what to avoid. Thanks!",skiing,1577737521,across7777,True,2019-12-30,1
First ski purchase,"Hi everyone,

Canadian recreational skiier here. :) I'd like to buy my first pair of skis. I've been multiple times before as a kid and always found it really fun. I'd only go a couple times (1-3) a year.

*Here is some information about me:*

* **Height:** 160cm (\~5'2"")
* **Weight:** 48-50kg (\~105-110 lbs)
* **Ability:** Beginner-Intermediate but recreational - I can ski parallel on red and black runs but have never tried going on the terrain park (although I would love to try at least once when I'm ready hehe). Since this is recreational (i.e. would go with friends), I'd likely spend most my time on green/blue/red.
* **Ski style/preferences:** casual, occasional, don't really go on moguls (went once) but want that option. Basically something that would grow with me as I improve

Larger boot size for infrequent intermediate skiier?,"I grew up in a downhill skiing family but stopped for the past 10-12 years.

A couple years ago I made it out for one day, with some rather tight-fitting boots. I think these were the last new boots I bought, ten years prior, and they look hardly worn at all. My feet hurt significantly during and afterwards. I chalked it up to getting a bad fit or my feet getting bigger. These are size 28-28.5 as printed on the shell. I wear a size 12-13 shoe (12.5 running shoe). 

Earlier this week I went skiing with my brother and had a great time. It was surprisingly easy to get back to cruising down Blue trails, though I feel like I have no idea what I am doing beyond instinct and muscle memory! This time I rented boots, 29.5, had to buckle them down pretty tightly but had a pretty comfortable day and no residual pain (the rental shop actually tried to put me in a 30.5 to start which felt way too roomy). 

With a renewed sense of ""hey, skiing is a blast, I should do this more often"" (dating an avid skier doesn't hurt either) and a weekend trip planned for later in the season, I decided to hit up a local shop/bootfitter to get some new boots and avoid dealing with rentals or the foot pain of my old boots. 

I know I'm only going to make it out some 2-3 times/year max, probably always on well-groomed piste, and I'm unlikely to try to push it beyond Blue trails or maybe the easiest of Blacks. 

The bootfitter measured me ""closer to 28.5 than 29.5"" but had me try on various 29.5 boots and I walked away with a pair of Dalbello IL Moro MX 110: size 29.5, 110 flex. 

The logic behind the larger size, according to the bootfitter, was that since I am only getting out occasionally, I won't want to deal with ""breaking in"" smaller boots and having my couple days on the mountain be painful. 

This made sense to me, but I've since read a bunch online about ski boot fitting (something I knew basically nothing about!), and now I'm wondering if I made a mistake. I haven't skiied in the new boots yet so they would be still be easy to return/exchange. 

With my foot forward in the shell, I have about 2.5cm between my heel and the back of the shell. Standing up straight in the assembled boot, my big toe hits the front of the liner and shell, but does not touch when bending into a ski position. 

I had been thinking my old boots were the wrong size, or even somebody else's boot altogether (memory gets hazy after a decade), but now I feel like they were probably a ""performance fit"" and never broken in?

Anybody here ski occasionally and up-size their boot to match? Will I be in sad-town as soon as I hit the slopes with these larger boots? 

I don't care about *maximum performance*, and I really would prefer to not have foot pain for my casual occasional skiing days, however I also don't want things to feel slow and sloppy, nor do I want to injure myself.

I've read a bit of recommendations on this sub, and have in general been a lurker here too for a while, but I'm still a bit unsure of where to go. 

One of the things I have to take into consideration is that I'll be travelling with my parents, though we'd probably be skiing different slopes most of the days. Their skill level is around that of managing to link together parallel turns but not having any separation between upper and lower body, and in the places we've skiied (Perisher AU, Queenstown NZ, Niseko JP, Yongpyong KR), they're happy on the green runs and maybe a blue or two.

Together we've been skiing for the past 5-6 years, though each year we only go for a combined maybe 10-15 days at most. 

Also, given the travel times to the states/Canada and back, we're likely only doing this trip once, so we do want to make the most of it.

Currently, I'm looking at doing something along the lines of heading up to Whistler for a week or so, then coming down to CO for Breck and Keystone. Total time ~4 weeks. Price isn't a big limiting factor for us.

On the other hand, I've heard a lot of good stuff about CB, Vail, and also around Lake Tahoe. Given that this would be (likely) our last ski trip together this far away from home, where would you all recommend for this trip?",skiing,1577779716,morganlei,True,2019-12-31,1

Using booster straps without removing existing straps,"Probably a stupid question. Anyone know if it’s possible to use booster straps “on top of” existing Velcro straps? I’ve considered buying some because my boots are much too big around my calves (bootfitter wasnt the best to say the least..), and i’m having trouble really tightly controlling my skis because of this (2 weeks skiing with the boots prebiously and heading for a week in mid jan). Went to a proper boot fitter yesterday who recommended booster straps and i’ve heard a lot of great things about them. 

But i’m kinda scared to drill out the existing strap if i mess up or hate the boosters :/ i know its stupid to be worried about, but i wonder if its possible to just place the boosters below the existing one and run it on “the inside”, and just loosely closing the regular strap outsider as usual? I mean, if the other strap isn’t in the way, is it essential to have the booster bolted on instead of just being able to perhaps move a little side to side?

I do my best have separation between my upper and lower body, keeping my shoulders pointing down the slope and have my hands out infront of me at roughly chest level as well as pole planting to help initiate the turns. But it still never quite looked fluid and relaxed.

My girlfriend is Canadian and I’m Swedish. We live in Europe and have mostly skied in Scandinavia and the Alps.

"I'm an intermediate skier who feels competent on blue runs and easier black diamonds. What would be a good prescription for getting more to the level of ""expert""?","I primarily ski the resorts around Socal (big bear, mammoth, baldy, etc). When things are groomed or packed, it's not too big a deal if it gets steep, and I don't have any worry about going fast.

However, i skied powder for the first time the other day (two days after a storm, and it started to get above freezing, so the snow was slow and sticky), and it got difficult to navigate steeper runs, especially when it started to get packed down by other skiers, making the terrain variable. Like, weight on the front of the ski didnt seem to help since if a spot of snow was soft, it would cause the tip of the ski to start going inside, and I had to resort to picking up my inside ski to facilitate turns on steep ground. The way i figured i had to navigate on powder was sitting back on the skis and letting the tail of the ski do much of the work. 

I talked to a couple of ski team kids at one of the mountains who happened to be sharing a lift with me, and they mentioned things like stance, body separation, pole plants, etc. I feel like part of my issues have been also that i dont always keep my skis together 100% of the time.

How to go Skiing Dirt Cheap,"So I want to go skiing next winter with upwards of 4 friends, I've never had to organise a trip before and looking into getting the cheapest accommodation, flights, ski passes etc is all quite daunting. Wondering how other people plan their trips and what some realistic budgets are for the most economical trip.

I live in the UK, one of the 4 is a school teacher so were pretty much limited to school holidays, would be looking to fly or if in France maybe drive if it offered a decent saving. Looking around I feel if you book up last minute and get a bit lucky with flights it looks like you could get a weeks holiday in for under £300 before food, am I being massively optimistic or has this happened? Under £500 seems a widely achievable goal (with a few compromises and being money savvy) is £300 pushing it? I understand everyone wants a cheap holiday and it's annoying having people with no clue bombarding forums trying to go skiing on the cheap but all the articles I find are very uninformative, seeming to target people wanting to get their £1200 holiday down to under £1000, not more budget people. I can't seem to find a blueprint to plan out a trip and was hoping some Redditors could be helpful (and hopefully this could be useful to others in the future planning trips).

I figured (as with flights) the cheapest trips would be either months in advance or very last minute, looking on various websites this doesn't seem to be the case as last-minute trips are ridiculously cheap:

[£109 for 7 nights with lift pass included!](https://preview.redd.it/i0l3i4uwx6841.png?width=2068&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f18568c02beda2dc8b806615fedfaae631c1d0b)

and the few places with December 2020 (12 months from now) available for booking seem just the regular cost (no discount for booking 12 months in advance):

&amp;#x200B;

[from £604pp, not really the discounts I was hoping for](https://preview.redd.it/soi39n8cy6841.png?width=2294&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bd1b4c4e95484c95fade67453c030f745c08eea)

I understand everyone wants to go for a cheap ski holiday and it costs a lot to maintain a resort so they have a minimum price they can charge but the widely varying costs online have really thrown me and I'm not too sure how to go forward. Help would be much appreciated.

For notes [https://www.sunweb.co.uk/](https://www.sunweb.co.uk/) seems the best place I've found to start, lift passes are included and often the price of accommodation with the pass is cheaper than the pass individually. I was thinking AirBnB could work out cheaper, especially if it was further from the main resort but when going to the lift pass websites their often so expensive it wipes out any saving from the accommodation (verses a package with accommodation). Tips such as making your own sandwiches or staying away from on-piste restaurants are cool but don't really give the savings I think most budget first-time skiers are looking for.",skiing,1577898424,Alexander_D_Cossey,True,2020-01-01,1

Warm + non-bulky options for 0-10F temps?,"Hey all, skied Keystone past week and there were some cloudy 0-10F days in there where I was really shivering most of the day.  My base layer was either a North Face ""Warm"" Crew Neck, which is 180g/m 100% poly, or the Patagonia Capilene Thermal Weight, 92% poly / 8% spandex.  I've lost a lot of weight since purchasing them, so they're a bit loose and I'd ideally go a size down; I know baggy is less efficient at insulating.  I tried a combo of both or doubling of one, didn't help all that much.  Outer was my combo jacket (insulated down inner + waterproof outer North Face).

I strongly dislike the bulk of doubling up, but it does work for me in the 20's.  In 0-10 it's inadequate, and I feel really packed in.

Is there anything supremely warm but not bulky or is that just a pipe dream?  I hate feeling constrained by the bulk of the clothing as I like to ski the trees where less resistance to quick movement means less tiring and more enjoyable days.

Teaching your own kids VS. Ski School: The Debate.,"Looking for advice:

I have two very physically able boys ages 5.5 and 2 years old. New Years Eve was the first day of the season for us; Day 3 (ever) of skiing for older and Day 1 for younger.  

I’m a capable, yet infrequent skier, the runt of the family of beautiful skiers. My husband is a boarder. We have taken the older boy skiing one day each year for the past two and this year we are excited to really get him started and commit to 3-4 long weekends at Mammoth, CA. 
(We weren’t planning on starting the little dude this season, and just expected to trade off childcare, but we found some used gear his size and he literally started running in his boots....he was ready). 

We had a brutally rough day logistically. I couldn’t find anywhere good to start the little guy, so just used the flat area by ski school. I then got the older one set up on his own doing the t-bar tiny run. I finally broke down and paid for afternoon lesson for the older and took the younger up on a huge chair with a REALLY long run, which meant I carried him down the last 3rd. He did excellently, but it was just too much. 

Here’s the thing: I want to teach my boys to ski, but I don’t have any knowledge in it other than being taught by my parents who were both instructors and watching (not very informative) YouTube videos. My kids proved yesterday that they won’t really follow my instruction, they both just want to go fast and straight down the mountain. Plus, I would love to get in a few runs by myself or with my husband, not in snow plow and not arguing. 

BUT, Group lessons are terribly expensive, in addition to doing a ski trip in general (let alone 3 or 4 trips). The amount of waiting around time just kills me. And I feel terrible giving up the chance of us having this learning experience together, by just giving up and putting them in lessons. 

I’ve heard the good pro list for kid group lessons, I’m just wondering if anyone has any positives for doing it yourself? Or maybe some combination of both?

10 days near denver; apart from Breckenridge where else to go?,"Following a work trip the wife and I will.be able to have 10 days around Denver and want to get some skiing in.

However she is committed and really wants to develop the skill now that we have kids in ski school and wants to develop good lifetime ski habits fromThe start.

The resort said all their instructors were  booked for the day but if I had a specific name they could be requested and she could be added to a wait list and recommended I ask around.

Wanted to see if anyone knew of anyone that would be a good fit for her in the park city area.  Preferably female but honestly just a great teacher is all that matters.

Intermediate overweight skier seeking advice,"Hi all,

Thank you for taking the time to read this post. I am seeking advice from fellow ski fanatics of all sorts and experiences. I am very anxious to post this (mind my English, I am not a native speaker) but here it goes;

I am a *26yr old - 195cm - 130kg intermediate skier with about 12 years* (read 12 trips) of experience in skiing **Blue**, **Red** and **mild Black** slopes in the Austrian Zillertal area and French Val Thorens area. As you can tell by my body info, I am a bit disproportionate. Regarding my weight; I read that it is important to know that where the weight actually is. Most of my 'extra' weight is in my stomach area and upper legs.

I learned how to ski at the age of 6 - 12 where I went skiing almost every year. Over the past few years I've skied only a handful of times. It is that the last 3 years I've gained a lot of weight and am now anxious to go skiing again. The last time was about 2 years ago (also 130kg at the time) and it went fine to my guess. I only had to quit twice as my legs were tiring about 4 hrs into skiing (9.00 - 13.00)

This year I am going skiing with my friends in the Les Deux Alpes area in France and I am very nervous and clueless on what to expect. I am seeking for your experience and advice in how to ski in a more relaxed way so that my body does not require a lot of energy and force from my legs like it did last time. I know how to ski but it is also a mental thing where I am scared to mess up and I am not as agile as I just to be all those years ago.

Again, thank you and I look forward to discussing your advice and learning from your experiences.",skiing,1578008295,MachineGunBenny,True,2020-01-02,1

Is there ever an okay reason/time to use a Bluetooth speaker on the mountain?,"I have a JBL Flip speaker I use while skiing now, and I usually keep it at a moderate to low volume. I always wear a helmet, and I have tried using earbuds and the helmet speaker chip things that you can put into your helmet, but because of my sensitive ears, they can cause my ears to hurt and are also generally uncomfortable. 

I have a playlist consisting of a mix of songs such as classical music like Tchaikovsky (40%), holiday music like the song We Need a Little Christmas (5%), musical/broadway music like from Hello, Dolly! (10%), rock/classic rock like the song Fortunate Son (30%), and others including ragtime songs, and just a general mix of other stuff (15%). It’s stuff generally people aren’t interested in cause it’s really not popular stuff or anything and I realize that not everyone will like it. I’m aware that there are a lot of younger children on the mountain, so I don’t play any suggestive songs or explicit songs, and quite a few of the songs don’t have words at all. 

Whenever I go into a lift line, I turn the volume off until I get off of the lift, or if I’m skiing with friends, at a low volume while riding up. I’m not looking for attention. I just want to listen to some of my own music, and I do really try to not affect anyone else listening to music because I know not everyone wants to listen to my music. 

By doing this, would this be the best way to keep everyone else happy on the mountain while allowing myself to listen to my own music? Thank you!

Edit: I can’t really wear headphones with a helmet, sorry...

Edit 2: When I say I keep it at a low to moderate volume, I’m talking maybe 3 tick marks of volume at most, generally 2. Not even 1/4 of full volume.",skiing,1578023044,Brorkli,True,2020-01-02,1

What's the correct chairlift etiquette? Was he the asshole or was I?,"So I mostly do night skiing and it has never been crowded. It is my first season, so I am not yet familiar with all the correct etiquette. So far this season, the lines at chairlifts are either nonexistant or really short, so I never feel bad going up solo in the chair, or I'll pair up with someone else. 

Tonight was a whole other world. The resort was absolutely jam packed. When I got to the line, I was first by myself, and then 3 guys came next to me and we naturally started to go up the line together (four-person chair).  The line was quite long, so we must have been next to each other for 20 minutes. But when we got really close to the gates, the guy at my left sort of pushed me as if I was invisible to him, got in front of me and sat down on the railing on the far right that guides the skiers and completely cut my access to what would have been my place to go up the four person chair. 

I was absolutely blown away by this behaviour and for me that is a complete lack of good manners (""savoir-vivre""). Considering that the line was extremely long, that they were three and me solo, that we had been queuing together for 20 minutes, it was obvious to me that we would go up in the same chair. 

I politely asked twice the guy that cut me off if I could join them and he finally agreed, though it was really obvious he was annoyed by it. 

For me, he is the asshole and I have to admit I let it kind of ruin my night. But I might be wrong and, am I the asshole? Was I wrong to assume we would go up together? What's the chairlift etiquette like? Please enlighten a newbie...",skiing,1578024299,futurecatdoctor,True,2020-01-02,1

Any recommendations for Italy??,"Hey everyone,

My brother, dad, and I are planning a ski trip to Italy from February 12-19th (approximate dates). We are considering both the Dolomites and the Alps. 

Our concerns were the following: 

\- I've read that the skiing is generally pretty easy in Europe relative to North America (with the exception of parts of France). Is it too easy? We are looking for something similar to whistler or Revelstoke in terms of difficulty. Only skiing considered, would it be better just to stay in BC? It would be pretty shitty to end up all the way there and kinda bored. Ive read numerous times on reddit that the blacks there (mainly italy) are like blues in NA.

\- We are choosing mainly between Cervinia and Cortina. Does anyone have any personal preferences/opinions/ recommendations as to which one would be preferred? pros and cons of each

Additional info: We are open to France, Swizterland, Austria etc. but are heavily leaning towards Italy since we speak Italian and also due to it being cheaper. (also food!)

Changing ski jacket/pant/bib styles...,"Hi all...

So I've been using the same ski jacket and bibs for 20 years.  I'm going on a ski trip soon, and washed them both.  The jacket is a Marmot Alpinist  (a GoreTex shell jacket), and the bibs are a Spyder model from that time.

After washing, the seam tape in the Marmot started peeling off.  I can send it to Marmot to see if they think it's repairable, but meanwhile I need a new jacket, and might upgrade my bibs as well.

I've been a little disheartened about the current styles of jacket, and somewhat of bib styles, available.  My old clothes are very sturdy and practical; the jacket cuff velcro is wide and long so I can really tighten the cuffs.  There is a cinch cord on my true waist, as well as a second one on the bottom of the jacket.  The jacket is cut in a fitted style.

Current jackets all seem to be big and roomy and square, but then are tight at the bottom.  There is only a cinch cord at the bottom, not at the true waist; this means that the jacket binds when I crouch, even with the cinch cord completely loose... a strange ""feature"" to have on a skiing jacket.  The fabrics are a lot lighter, but the jackets don't seem nearly as sturdy.

Does anyone know why styles have changed like that?  Why fabrics are so much lighter but don't seem sturdier?  Why they are boxy instead of fit?  Why there's no cinch cord at the true waist, etc?

Also, bibs seem to be cut a lot tighter than I used to, even accounting from my middle-aged belly.

From what I can tell, the rise of popularity in other styles of skiing, and also crossover from snowboard fashion, is causing some of this.  But it's damned annoying that no company seems to be making a jacket like my old Marmot.",skiing,1578039472,tbessie,True,2020-01-03,1

I love the feel of the Menace for the higher speed and the long radius carvings, but my skiing is now sloppy at low speed; my short radius carving and short skid turns are horrible.  Any tips to break my old habits? I know it sounds ridiculous but I'm at a loss for words right now.

Stick with rentals or buy?,"Hey! Looking for some advice on whether or not to pull the trigger on skis. I've got a pair of well-fitting boots that I love already, so that's a non-issue.

I learned to ski late last season. I'm in the PNW. I've been skiing 2-3 times a week since the resorts here opened at the beginning of the month, and plan to continue doing so for the duration of the season as well as hit up a few other resorts on the IKON. Given the frequency I'm skiing, I feel like I've already improved leaps and bounds. I'd call myself an early intermediate, super motivated skier at this point. I mostly ski with friends that are advanced and have been skiing since they were kids. I'd like to be able to ski harder runs with them and feel like I'm not holding them back eventually.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 5'7, 125lb woman. I picked up some season rentals from a ski shop at the onset of the season (Atomic Affinity 158cm - [https://sportconcept.com/ski/skis/3339-Atomic-Affinity-R](https://sportconcept.com/ski/skis/3339-Atomic-Affinity-R)). I've got my turns down and feel pretty confident going down easy blues and do alright but am more cautious with harder blues. Haven't tried anything past that.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering if it's best to stick with these rentals for the season or try some demos and maybe buy something longer, wider, and with a wood core?  Specifically interested in a 90-98ish all mountain ski, as I'd like to be able to hit powder when the opportunities come up, and I doubt these lil guys will hold up in that. I guess I'm torn because I understand that I may outgrow skis if I were to buy them right now, but I also don't want to be held back by the rentals this season (given how often I'll be going).

Skiing on Christmas?,"Hey all. My family and I are in a heated debate I am hoping y'all can help settle. 

Context: I work at a ski resort, and get emails about when to be IN a canyon (not leaving the house) as to allow appropriate timing to get to work between 15 and 30 minutes prior to the chairs operating. 

The current estimate for the holidays is: be in the canyon at 7am (or earlier) to be at the resort by 8:30-8:45am. 

My mother (who wants to ski at the resort I work at) is saying that if we leave the house at 8am (without traffic is a 60 minute drive to the mouth of the canyon) we won't encounter traffic because it's Christmas morning. But there is fresh pow on the way, and an enthusiastic amount of it too. 

My fear is that given the fresh snow, the warnings saying: canyon traffic will be bonkers, and that canyons are usually gridlocked by 8am (not on holidays) with possibly 1-3 hour long traffic jams (in the canyon... not counting the shit outside the canyon), we are in for a clusterfuck of epic proportions. I'd love to not deal with that on Christmas. 

My sister hates traffic jams, I hate traffic jams, my mom hates crowded resorts, and my dad won't even be able to come because he's working on dinner. Not to mention, if he did come, we could only stay until 1pm ish so he could get dinner done.

Breckenridge Questions,"My wife and I are looking to visit in February. I saw there's a shuttle from the airport that's about $98 per person roundtrip or we can rent a crossover/SUV for about $225. We were thinking of staying in the Peak 8 Village. I haven't been to breck in a decade, does anyone have any opinion on which option is better? Obviously being driven vs driving is a perk and we'd have to buy our own gas &amp; pay tolls, I just didn't know if having a car would make things any more flexible. The shuttle website says we can each have 3 bags, then its $20 extra/bag. We'd each have our own skis, boots, checked luggage, and backpack so hopefully we wouldn't be charged the extra $20x2.

&amp;#x200B;

Last time I was in Breck I stayed with family and didn't see much of the town so originally I was thinking that having a car might be nice to drive around and do stuff? Or can you basically get to everything via Shuttle/walking/uber?

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus Question... is there any resort you'd recommend over Breck when considering my wife is an intermediate skier?

Advice on learning to go faster (safely) on a traverse? - That person who keeps stopping on the traverse,"I’m still new to skiing but can ski down greens and blues in Heavenly/Squaw.

However, I have a lot of trouble controlling my speed/feeling confident on narrow traverses, even if the slope is gentle. The problem is worse when the traverse is crowded and or/there is ice.

Intellectually I understand why I need to pick up more speed to get through the flatter sections and keep with the flow of traffic. Physically, I get very nervous and feel like I need to pull off the traverse (not always possible) or come to a brief but sudden stop (I’m sorry!!!!!) which is annoying and causes me to fall behind my group.

Do you guys have tips on building confidence on traverses? The usual “do it more” seems dangerous to everyone else on the route and I don’t pick up enough speed on shorter traverses. TIA",skiing,1577397097,rabburabbu,True,2019-12-26,1

Help a Noob With Boots!,"Hey all - first post here in /r/skiing so let me know if I'm breaking any rules. I've read the FAQ/beginner's guide and know that a good boot-fitter is going to be the #1 suggestion here, but I'm in a bit of a weird situation.  
  
I live in Texas and once or twice (if I'm lucky) per year, I make the trek up to New Mexico or Colorado to get 3-4 days of skiing. Basically, I've only ever used rental equipment, but their boots are AWFUL. I suffer from severe shin pain by the second day, usually to the point where I can maybe suffer through one run and then I have to go take my boots off for a while to recover.  I've researched this quite a bit and believe it's due to my ""weird"" shaped feet which cause me to get a larger size than truly necessary and results in shin bang.  
  
Additionally, with me being in Texas, there's no such thing as a good boot-fitter down here and each time we travel up north, I really don't have the time to spend at a shop for that long, nor the money (I can't justify spending more than a couple hundred bucks on boots I'll only use 1-2 times per year).  
  
I've measured as much as I can measure and searched and found a few boots, but I would really appreciate it if you guys could take a look and let me know if you have any recommendations for sub $300 (preferably $200ish) boots that may help me out. I know this budget is tiny, but just hoping I can do better than rentals.  
  
Length (mondo): 30.5cm
Width (last): 108-110cm (yes, I have ridiculously wide feet)
Instep/arch height: 30cm so ""normal"" volume
Beginner to low intermediate (mostly Greens/Blues but can do more occasionally), heavier guy (275lbs) so thinking somewhere around 80 flex.  
Calf volume: Fairly normal (not sure if there's a specific way to measure this?).

I get paid 11 an hour and that would only go up a dollar per cert level lol. That being said I really dont care about the money as it is something I really enjoy to do. I get more satisfaction seeing my kids and teenagers progress than a paycheck ever could. That being said when I move out west next fall after I graduate I have some questions:
I am wondering how important certs are over experience?

What do I need to do to not work with beginners? (At least in mn about 4/10 of the very beginner kids I worked with actually want to ski, their parents know this but use me more as a babysitter. This is increadibly frustrating. 

Will I be able to do anything racing related without certs? I can set courses both gs and sl to fis and Ussa standards and have a very good eye for what racers need to work on.

Just converted from an insulated jacket to a 3 layer gore-tex shell. Looking for layering advice.,"Hi Everyone - 

Been using a gore-tex insulated jacket for about a decade and I am used to layering with it. Typically for east coast resort skiing (which is where I do 75% of my skiing), I'll throw on a thin capilene base layer, then a performance better sweater or something similar, and then my jacket. This keeps me warm in 15 degree mornings and I have the pit zips for when it warms up to 30. On warm days I have to unzip a bit with this layering.

Now, with the 3 layer gore-tex shell, I'm scared I'll either be too hot or too cold. My game plan for most coldish east coast days (VT/NH) would be the same capilene baselayer, my patagucci micropuff, and the shell. I'd also think about the capilene baselayer, a pullover like the better sweater, my micro puff vest, and then the shell.

Looking for any and all advice. Thanks.

Beginner Ski for Wife,"Hey all, long time lurker but made an anonymous account as to surprise my wife.  

My wife learned to ski briefly when she was 7 but only went once or twice.  She then Switched to snowboarding for her teen years but never got competent.  

Now that we have two kids she wants to learn to ski for them and is committed to investing the time and energy to learn.

I have her set up with a boot fitter so that way we can skip some of the learner discomfort of rentals.  

I am curious what ski you would recommend for a true beginner who is athletic.  

I would normally just rent but I want to do whatever I can to give her the best reintroduction experience as possible.

She is 35 5’3 and 105 lbs.  skiing primarily park city / deer valley etc.

I am incredibly fortunate that money isn’t a concern in terms of getting her set up.  Even if it means she outgrows them in a few weeks.  As I would rather invest the money for her potential enjoyment and hopefully end up with her being fully addicted.  If we can demo them even better but not required.

She is going to be going back to ski school and doing privates as well the beginning of January.

This post is entirely selfishly motivated as the more comfortable she is and the better fit; the more time on the mountain for us all.


Also the fact that we have two kids under three makes it a logistical challenge where we have to be incredible efficient with our time on the mountain.

Multiple questions about buying skis,"So I've been skiing for a few years, I currently own a pair of [K2 Amp Strikes](https://www.evo.com/outlet/skis/k2-strike) (153 cm) and some Head Edge Next 75s (apparently these boots don't exist online, but mine are size 28.0 and 329mm). I am 5' 10"" and weigh 136 pounds. I consider myself an intermediate skier, and am comfortable on the majority of what I find locally, except for a few of the double blacks.

Recently I've wanted to get into more freestyle/park skiing. I thought that it would be a good idea to get some new skis too. So I decided to start looking for some twin tip skis. Living in the Midwest, ski shops are very hard to find, and the local one only sells all-mountain and free-ride skis. Meaning that I have to buy online, after looking around on Evo and Skiessentials I found a pair of [2019 Volkl Bash 89s](https://www.evo.com/outlet/skis/volkl-bash-89) (the local shop is able to bind them for me, though I don't know much about that either). Having only skied on rentals and the K2s I mentioned earlier, I have no idea how these skis will handle. I also don't know if I'm getting a good deal. 

So my questions are-

1. Is this a good purchase? If not, what would you recommend I look for?
2. How should i have them bound? I would assume in the center of the ski because that seems to be how most people I see skiing park bind them, but as I said I have no experience with this.^(1)
3. How will the new skis handle compared to my current skis? 

I also found these [2018 Armada ARV 84 Junior Skis](https://www.skiessentials.com/2018-armada-arv-84-junior-skis-w-tyrolia-attack2-11-gw-bindings.html), I was considering them, but the reviews seem to say that they break easily. 

^(1)Also are all bindings adjustable? My K2s let me size them to the boot, but from the pictures I've seen some of them look like they aren't.",skiing,1577484853,EmergencyShotput,True,2019-12-27,1

Ski set up for Interior BC,"Hey r/skiing, so I'll be skiing Whitewater in Nelson, BC for the next two months and plan on getting into some backcountry/sidecountry while I'm there. I'm an agressive and technical skiier on piste but have less experience in powder. I currently have some race skis and twin tips (84mm underfoot) and am looking for something wider to add to my quiver. I'm set on the shift bindings, but don't know how wide I should be going for a good 50/50 set up. The current skis on my radar (from widest to narrowest) are:

Black Crows Atris Birdie 108 (169.1cm)
Salomon QST 106 (174cm)
Head Kore 105 (171cm)
Line Pandora 104 (172cm)
Blizzard Sheeva or Rustler 10 102 (172cm)

So some questions I have are:

Will the Atris be too wide for skiing the trees? Will they be too wide that I can't adapt to them on groomers? I've heard the QST is a charger, but it also seems to be the heaviest of the list. Will their weight be too much of a hindrance when getting into backcountry? I tested the Line Pandora's in a 165cm at Whitewater on a powder day and loved them. Are these still good skis when the conditions aren't optimal? They're the cheapest on the list, but why and will they last? Is the Sheeva noticeably softer than the Rustler? Which skis would you pick of the list to pair with some shift bindings?

I'm very frustrated and just confused.,"Background: Been skiing since I was 4 years old and I was probably in my prime then. I then took a huge gap (moved back to London) and skied again 10 years later at 14. I was shit. Unlike most people who start at a young age I lost the brain connections on how to ski. Anyway now I'm 16 and on a trip this week leaving tomorrow and I've been trying all week to parallel ski but it's not on.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not terrible, I can ski ok. The only thing that pisses me off is that when going down the mountain I'm thinking how to get down, not how to ski down. My parallel is shaky. I've tried all the tricks in the book from outside foot weight, leaning forward, bending knees etc... Asked many people and skied with those better. However I just can't seem to consistently make S turns. I'm fairly confident as well. In fact, I'd rather bomb it down then bother with turning which is what I do sometimes. Maybe it's the skis or boots but I doubt it. I've been trying for s full week on varying terrains but mainly on an easy blue and I just can't get it right.

Warmest Intuition Tongued Model?,"I’ve been skiing since I was 3 years old and now I’m a fully grown human and a hell of an aggressive skier. As such I finally bought a pair of boots: 

K2 Recon 120 MV (not the heated model I didn’t know that existed at the time)

They’re breaking in, I love how light they are and how they perform, but for the life of me my toes FREEZE when I’m wearing them. While I was still growing, every year I’d rent a brand new pair of Dalbello Scorpions, use them for 50-100 days per season, and I was never quite this cold in them. I also use Hotronics, and on either the 1 or 2 setting I was always fine. Now even on the 4 setting, when I pull my feet out of my boots and remove my socks, my toes are at least 20 degrees colder than they should be.

I’m gonna get intuition liners. I’m an aggressive skier and with the Intuitions I should get a little more charge outta my boot and I’ve heard they stay warmer in the toes. That being said, I’m curious which are the WARMEST models. The local ski shop has a pro tongue in my size which seems good.

Ski patrol in gap year - Europe,"Hi guys,

So I'm british and have aspirations to go to medical school. I've decided I'd like to work as a ski patroller in my gap year to get more experience in the medical field. I'd preferably like to do this in Austria, France or Germany because I can speak some German and French.

For Austrian and German ski patrol I can't find any relevant courses for it so I'm unsure, so if anyone knows of anything to do with this please let me know how long the course is and what the prerequisites are. I'm 16 and I'm expecting the age to be 18 and I'm prepared to learn German for the next two years in order to become fluent.

My next question is that I've found a course in Scotland that lasts a week and is organised by BASP (British Association of Ski Patrol), is this internationally recognised?

Also would it all be possible? Would I need an extra gap year to actually become a ski patroller or should I just go for a different seasonaire job? And how would I go about getting hired? Please tell me anything else I should know!

Thank you!",skiing,1577581623,CaptainPotNoodle,True,2019-12-28,1

Just had the worst experience at Big Sky Mt.,"So first off, Big Sky is a great resort and the skiing there was awesome except for this. So I decided to do one easy blue groomer at the end of the day, probably one of last runs I thought. My legs were tired but not too tired. I took a fall halfway through the run and my bindings fell off. They came clean off and I had to slide/walk the whole way down, only too take a lift up, and then down a 5 mile run to get back to base. I then gave my skis to ski repair and they said this will take a few days. So now I have to pay a lot more money to rent skis.

Issues with foot cramping - suggestions?,"Let me know if I'm breaking any rules - not posted in skiing communities before because I consider myself strictly recreational.

I've skied for ten years now and I'm currently on a trip skiing in Italy. It was our first day and I've noticed my feet cramp something awful under my arches which makes skiing everything but enjoyable. If it's something I can fix like technique, I'd love to know so I can actually enjoy the rest of the trip lol. The cramping has always been an issue but it's been much worse today than normal.

So far, suggestions have been:
My boots are too small / don't fit right
I'm too heavy for skiing
My technique is wrong 

I'm willing to hold my hands up and say I think it's technique. I *can* ski and I can do all the traversing and turning, I'm just an extremely nervous skier and default to panic at the first sign of difficulty. I had a nasty fall a few years ago that tore my meniscus, which went untreated for two years and will likely be a lifelong issue now. It's knocked my confidence and I know it's unreasonable to still be nervous five years later but I'm not sure how to overcome it. Because I honestly don't care if I improve (I only ski for fun) I've never really considered technique to be a huge issue but if it's causing this pain then I'd do anything to correct it at this point.

If it's likely to be boots or my weight, I suppose that's something I'll have to deal with so any suggestions on how to ease the cramping for now would be very welcomed too.",skiing,1577629859,HearThePeopleSing,True,2019-12-29,1

"After 15 years of snowboarding, I finally clipped into skis for the first time ever yesterday. ( a few beginner questions inside)","Hello skiing community.   I (34 M) have been snowboarding for 15 + years and yesterday, after years of making fun of skiing/promising that I would finally learn, I pulled the trigger and tried skiing for the first time.   It honestly went a lot better than I thought it was, and besides almost falling on my head trying to walk on a tile floor in ski boots it was a incident free day of learning. 

The main reason I finally decided to give it a try is this is my  sons (3 years old) first year skiing, and I figured we could learn together (my wife skis).   Anyway I have a few questions that maybe you can help me answer (mostly about gear, so you can skip this if you don't feel like answer g these questions again):

I know the FAQ section says it's better to rent over buying used for a beginner, but I live in an area with an extreme over supply of used gear so you can get a nice used set of skis/poles for well under the price of renting.   I doubt I switch exclusively to skiing but I will commit to it for the rest of this year.  I plan on buying a set of skis/boots/poles now on the cheap, then upgrade when I feel like I'm good enough.  So my question are:

- where I live there is a lot of supply, but since everyone here starts skiing basically before they can walk, there are no beginner skis in around my size.   Most for sale would go between intermediate/advanced. Question one is, would getting a more ""advanced"" ski but in a slightly smaller size  make any difference?   And is learning on skis that are more advanced then my skill level make learning more difficult.

- when it comes to sizing, I'm  165 cm (5'6"") and about 75kg (165lb).   Yesterday i got 150cm beginner skis.   I was eyeing around the 155cm range for an all mountain ski.   Am I in the right ball park.

- I know boots are super important, is it best to just bite the bullet and spend the money on a new pair, or just buy a used set until I learn then buy a good pair when I'm ready.",skiing,1577634562,Herr_Poopypants,True,2019-12-29,1

Cold toes in boots that fit perfectly,"So I’ve done some research online but I’m wondering if anyone else has any ideas. 

I got new boots for this season, Salomon SMax100s, I’ve had them fitted, custom insoles made and small 6th toe punches. The boots fit great, no hot spots, I love them. I have 12-15 full days of early season skiing in them, and didn’t have any issues. As soon as the temps dropped below ~22 degrees Fahrenheit (-5.5 Celsius) my toes have been getting very cold within an hour or so of being outside (wind definitely makes it worse).  I wear thin smartwool socks. 

Observations - definitely worse on lift, I don’t know foot biology but it seems like the pressure on top of my feet from bearing the weight of the skis might contribute. Also a bit windier when on lift. 

What I think might be the main factor is my foot sweating in my winter boots before putting my ski boots on.

I don’t really have interest in heated socks or foot beds. I do think I’m more susceptible to cold feet/hands from a circulation standpoint but I don’t think it should be this bad. 

Things I’m going to try:

Strip of duct tape on the toe.

Anti perspiration cream of some kind

Unbuckling on the lift (what buckles do you undo here?)

Face mask/protection that's breathable and NOT warm,"Bit of an odd request that my searches didn't yield an answer for:

Anyone have advice on something they wear on their face that's not for warmth? I'm looking for protection from the sun and from windburn. I find that after a long day my face feels sunburned, even if it wasn't sunny AND I still applied sunblock and lip balm several times. I think it's wind burn, it's always gone by the next morning. 

Anyway I have something that's like a scarf and very thin, but it still seems to inhibit breathing a little, which doesn't help when you're hitting the moguls and putting in some effort. When it's cold out I have a warm face mask with holes around the mouth which works great but only when it's cold.

Only thing I've found is a company that makes face protection for fishing, so it'll help for wind/sun but I don't know how breathable it is once you start exerting yourself

Wedge Christie vs. Spontaneous Christie,"Hi all,

My son took a couple lessons last year and can do reasonable snowplow turns down easy New England greens.  He took one lesson so far this year.  I was watching in stealth mode from a distance (didn't want the ""dad's watching"" factor) and it looks like his turns are becoming reasonably parallel.  The instructor told me at the end they were practicing ""spontaneous Christies"".  I'd never heard that terminology before, but after googling, I guess it's a thing.  Is it completely synonymous with ""Wedge Christie""?

Could someone give a precise/concise definition of / distinction between ""stem"", ""wedge"", and ""spontaneous"" Christies? 

FWIW, I taught myself last year (starting in March) almost exclusively through the Elate Media youtube channel.  I took two group lessons and two 1-on-1, and they were not useful at all compared to the Elate Media channel.  And I think I've got a pretty decent turn now with all the basics working (so says a friend who is a very competent skier) -- so I'm a bit skeptical about the lessons vs. DOI and practice mentality.  But I digress: Would people consider lessons 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 from the Elate Media series ""Christies""?  He really emphasizes weight transfer in that 2.x lesson sequence and less about edging.  

More precise question: at the 1:15 mark in the lesson 2.1 video, is that a ""Stem Christie""?  It looks like his left ski is still inside/uphill edge engaged while the right ski is edge-disengaged completely flat and rotating a lot at a high steering angle (look at the tracks).  Is he still doing ""Christies"" of any kind by lesson 2.3?  It looks almost like a proper parallel turn by 2.3 with just a tiny bit of wedge in it.",skiing,1577025462,shademaster_c,True,2019-12-22,1

Chamonix Ski Area Advice,"I am traveling the Chamonix Valley in late January. I am looking for some advice on which ski area is best suited for myself and my friend's needs.

I will be skiing three days total - one by myself and one with a friend. In the US I am an advanced intermediate - comfortable on most black runs and generally like to be challenged. My friend is intermediate and would probably enjoy skiing in his comfort zone.

We are staying in the valley and will have a vehicle, so we are open to any area. Could you quickly suggest 1-2 areas for a day by myself and another 1-2 for the days we will be together? Are there off-piste options available to me that will not be extreme, but still a challenge? Is it worth hiring a guide?

Looking for a New Ski,"Greetings,

I am about to retire a pair of 2009 Volkl Mantras and am having a hard time choosing a replacement. I am most comfortable with blue/black on piste terrain. Trees are fun with fresh or preserved snow. I ski mostly in Northern New England with lots of hardpack and the occasional 50 yard stretch of ice. Here is a brief summary of my impression of the Mantras so hopefully someone can point me towards a good choice.

Pros:
Great for powder
Great for slush and crud
Can be very aggressive for ripping groomers

Cons:
Huge turn radius requires lots of work to ski less aggressively-this is really the main issue because of the nature of new england trails. Also, it kills my legs if I want to go less than 40mph.
Hard to get good turns on hard snow

Edging Inside Ski Help,"Hi all,

Had a great day out today, but it was old snow, hard packed and scraped off. My edges aren't super sharp anymore (thank you early season) but that's not an excuse. All day, I'd get my downhill ski on its inside edge (left ski when turning right, right ski when turning left) and for the most part be ok holding that edge. On any particularly icy spots, it would skitter a little and feel like the edge wasn't cutting into the slope. 

Additionally, in anything else other than very soft, new snow, I find I have trouble getting my inside ski (right ski turning right, left ski turning left) up onto the edge on the outside of the ski. My leg will drift up, creating space between my skis, and stay relatively flat on the snow. 

Anyone have any tips on practicing getting your skis up on edge on your pinky toe side? I do tend to A frame my legs from the knees down, especially when my edges don't feel secure. I'm sure that's a bad habit I need to break...",skiing,1577057003,cjohns716,True,2019-12-22,1

Winter jacket quest,"Winter jacket quest

I don’t know where else to turn, so hoping y’all can help me. I’ve been doing research for 2 weeks on the warmest cost efficient winter jacket for women, something that’ll keep me warm in 10F and up at least. 

I finally narrowed it down to one that seemed to be suitable for below freezing temperatures: Marmot Montreal for Women[Marmot Montreal for Women](https://www.moosejaw.com/product/marmot-women-s-montreal-coat_10221622) 

When it got delivered, I noticed it’s pretty unflattering and boxy. It’s also not waterproof (I knew this before I bought it). It’s really warm (700 fill), I started to sweat when I took it for a test walk in 28F weather. 

Then I went to different stores to check out the fit of different jackets to see if I find something better, and I ended up coming across Women’s Outer Borough North Face jacket [Women’s Outer Borough North Face jacket](https://www.moosejaw.com/product/the-north-face-women-s-outer-boroughs-parka_10344753)

This one is $150 pricier, but looks better (I think). It’s also waterproof, north face is supposed to have a lifetime warranty, and has a bunch of pockets. I read a bunch of reviews that say it sheds feathers through the inner lining, and it’s also much heavier in weight being 550 down fill. 

I walked around outside the store, it was only 43F, but I felt slightly chilly. Having said that, the placebo effect works on me like crazy, if I think it might be less warm, I’ll totally believe it. 

I started comparing the two brands and the two jackets online, and a lot of websites rated north face has the better option (the brand, not specifically the jacket in question). Marmot is apparently more lightweight and for performance wear but rated not as warm as north face in general. 

I think I like the north face look better, but feel the marmot is warmer, and I think warmth is more important than looks. But the north face is  waterproof, so we’re back to square one.

Noob XC question: is there any other way of going downhill besides wedge?,"I am new to XC skiing - I took one lesson last year where they showed me the basics and then I spent last winter just getting comfortable moving around. I am better with that now and can pretty comfortable travel horizontal terrain and even go off the trail a bit (although it becomes more like walking than skiing).

Something I've been curious is if there is a better way to go downhill on XC skis (I have  Rossignol Evo 60). I've been doing the wedge they showed me but it's a bit boring and I don't feel that much in control - like if I had to stop abruptly, I don't think I would be able to. When there are some minor downhill slopes off trail, I just take off skis and walk - I probably can't make it past the bumpy ungroomed terrain and I almost certainly won't be able to stop fast enough if I happen to roll in the direction of edge.

So basically my question is - in terms of XC downhill, is there anything better than wedge or is it all there is for this type of skiing? If there is anything better, how do I get around getting that skill - just take another XC lesson or get a few lessons in alpine skiing?",skiing,1577130667,catinator9000,True,2019-12-23,1

Enforcer 100 vs Mindbender 99 ti,"I’ve been on demo skis yesterday and today with the intention of finally getting myself a pair. 
I tried the QST 106, Mindbender 99 ti, Daemon 99, Enforcer 93, and Iconic 84 ti. I found the Mindbender 99 to bay my favorite of all the skis I had a chance to ride. 
I went into this weekend with the the Enforcer 100 and QST 99 as my top choices. 
Unfortunately, mammoth didn’t have either available to demo on the mountain while I was here. But I found the 99 to be the best and most comfortable waist width I used. 

I absolutely loved the Mindbender, enjoyed how the narrower Enforcer felt, and hated how the wider QST actually felt. 

I’ve only seen positive reviews of the Enforcer 100 and think that the waist would be perfect and would go for it, if it weren’t for how much I enjoyed the Mindbender today. 

Anyone have any advice or opinion on if I should choose the Enforcer over the Mindbender. Or if I should just go with the Mindbender after the great experience I had today.

skis not stable at higher speed,"hey

i have a question regarding my skis. i am 180cm, 75 kg, used to ski a lot twentysomething years ago with long 2m non carving skis, i go down any track, advanced level i guess. i bought some used 165 cm atomic performer xt 2018 skis, i used them 3-4x times and at slow speed they are good. however if i go 30 km/h+ and on rough, uneven terrain or powder it is flexing around, not stable enough, hard to hold the skis parallel..just dont feel stiff enough when im kinda agressive. is it a problem with my technique,muscle strength or could it be the skis?

what kind of skis should i choose if i like going on tracks agressively, but like to do some powder/freeride skiing too?",skiing,1577175167,h0petortur3,True,2019-12-24,1

Hardshell Jackets - Skimp or Splurge?,"So I want to buy a good waterproof hardshell.

Skiing moguls with long skis,"I'm trying to decide between two ski lengths for a new ski. This ski will be 101 under foot and the skinniest ski I own. I currently have 106 and 115 underfoot. This ski will be more for ripping groomers, moguls, trees, and a little bit of park. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 5'9"" 175 and ski pretty hard. 

Current skis:

|Ski|length|waist|effective Edge|shape|turn radius|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Moment - Deathwish Tour |181cm|106mm|1458mm|Triple camber|Long (25m)|
|Armada - JJ|185|115|IDK|Rocker/Camber/Rocker|Long|

New Ski

||length|waist|effective edge|shape|turn radius|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Moment PB&amp;J|172|101|1379|Rocker/Camber/Rocker|med (18m)|
|Moment PB&amp;J|182|101|1479|Rocker/Camber/Rocker|med (21m)|

So I ski the Deathwish with full confidence in any moguls/trees, so I assume the 182 PB&amp;J would be fine for me in those situations, and I expect that the shorter turn radius and more narrow width would balance out the feel a bit. I also realize that the shorter option would likely allow me to ski moguls and trees better. I just wonder if I will be giving up too much in terms of stability at speed with the 172 length at my height. 

I will probably spend 2/3 of my time in trees and moguls with these skis the rest will be ripping groomers or 2 day old crud. I appreciate any input!",skiing,1577209010,hendric_swills,True,2019-12-24,1
Sore ankle tendon,"Hi guys, i have a problem i hope you can help me with. I have been skiing with new boots for 4 days now and i have two more days to go.

It hurts where the boot liner goes from horizontal to vertical. It hurts on both feet, the right foot more than the other. I went to see the bootfitter here, he said there is something whic hey can do about it and that my boots are the right size. Only they have no room to do it today. First they can do is tomorrow. In the meantime , what can i do to help my sore tendon heal quicker?

"Okay, I've got a gear challenge for you all.","Background: I'm a middle-aged guy who hasn't skiied (until yesterday) in 15 years.  Grew up in Park City, now live in Texas.  I used to do easier blacks with powder/crud/smallish moguls.  Narrow chutes with trees and crazy steep stuff never was my thing - I did a lot of carving and such on groomers too.  Maybe 60/40 groomers vs off-piste.  Never a crazy fast skiier.  

Every ski I have ever been on until yesterday was a old school straight ski.  Olin Mark IV was what I skiied for most of the time, 195 or 205 (I'm 6'1"", pushing 250 but dropping to 190 or so by the time I ski next).  


I'm on Salomon QST 92 (185 cm) right now.   After a miserable morning trying to figure out these new-fangled shaped ski things, I realized I was trying to hard with old technique.   After a bit more time and adjustment I liked them a lot. But since these are literally my first ones, I would like to know what else I should be looking at and what critiques you have.   


Assume same style as before - hard blues to blacks, not a crazy fast skiier (read 30 or 35 is the fastest I'll ever go likely), and all Western skiing in Utah/Colorado.

Help! Back problems!,"So last season was amazing. I made it out so often and a lot of the time was first chair to last chair and wanting more. This season is off to a rough start. I started Nov 16 and have been out a few times. I skied for 3 hrs on Sunday and now I can barely bend down to put my shoes on :(

I started training for the ski season in September (squats, planks, lunges, push-ups, and cycling on indoor bike) and about a month and a half ago I had a dull ache in my groin on the left side and the pain started to get worse and was radiating to my left lower back. Went to a few doctors who said it was an inguinal hernia. After some ultrasounds and cat scans, it all came back negative (no evidence of hernia) and so I went to my chiropractor who said it was a pelvic floor issue. I've been seeing him since last Monday and started to feel great (no issue with bending). So I decided to ski on Sunday and went pretty hard for the 3 hours. Was hitting everything, skiing very aggressively for 3 hrs straight and then my back started to hurt on the lower left side.

I've got a trip to Revelstoke on Jan 20 and I'm worried I'm not gonna make it at this point lol. 

Any advice on what I can do? Guessing I need to strengthen core and glutes?",skiing,1576513718,23style,True,2019-12-16,1

First time skier needing help. Frustrated after my first lesson.,"Went for my first time skiing a couple days ago. I had a 1 day - 2 hour lesson (ski school affiliated with the resort) but I feel it wasn't comprehensive enough for the absolute basics and didn't feel like the instructors knew how to help me when I brought up my concerns. For example, they never really went into how to emergency stop. The only way we were told how to stop is to complete a J-turn up a hill. I found myself sliding backwards a couple of times and I had no idea how to control and stop myself. I was not told anything about ""wedging"" or anything that I looked up prior to the class. All we went over was J-turns and a brief overview on how edging works when your perpendicular to the fall line.

I am also frustrated (And I know this is totally my fault) because almost everyone else in my group class of 7 proceeded on to skiing greens by the end of the class but I was still stuck practicing parallel J-turns on the training hill...and by the end of the 8 hour day practicing over and over I still couldn't do it.

My main source of frustration yesterday was indeed trying to link the parallel J-turns. Again which I had trouble doing on an almost basically flat incline training slope. 

I was told when turning in that direction to put weight through the outside/downhill foot and rotate your hip inward to initiate the turn. My problem was that I felt I was literally bearing down all my body weight on that foot but I wasn't turning. I was really forcing myself and pushing down hard and I felt my ACL was gonna snap at any moment but I kept going straight. Additionally, when I put weight through that foot, that ski starts edging into the snow blocking and further movement I could do to turn even more. I had trouble keeping it flat on the snow while trying to rotate it inward. I brought up these concerns to my instructors but they kept saying the same thing over and over ""Just put weight on that downhill foot, and turn your hip inwards"". It didn't help much. We even did drills for me to try turning on just one foot (keeping the other one suspended in the air) but I was too fearful and I still had trouble turning that downhill foot.

From the maybe...3 successful attempts (out of 40 on just this training hill alone), the completion of one J-turn took about 50-70 feet. Meanwhile I could see people doing it in 5-10 feet. I also had some instances where I did successfully turn, but I turned too much, and did a complete 180 degree turn, and I found myself sliding downhill backwards with no idea how to stop. 

I feel like I am overthinking this too much. I mean it looks so simple when I see people doing it, or in the same vein how they can just seamlessly stop and change direction without any force at all, but for me it takes at least 50 feet to change a simple 90 degree direction.",skiing,1576522195,upanddown557,True,2019-12-16,1

Suggestions for very short ski trip in Europe (from US),"Hi! I'm looking for a good place to ski in the Alps for a single day of skiing in late January. I live in the US and have to be in Eastern Europe for a work trip, and I've never skied in Europe before. So I'm trying to stop for a day (or 2 if I can swing it) somewhere in the Alps on my way...basically I'm looking for suggested mountains to check out. 

Now for options - I am currently looking at flights that have my stop to ski in either Zurich or Munich, but if there is a better city with lots of direct flights from the East Coast of the US I can look at flights there too. I'm okay having to rent a car, but I'll be renting gear at the mountain so public transit would work too if that is less expensive. I'm planning to arrive in some city on a Saturday morning, get to the ski area that day, stay overnight near the slopes, then ski all day Sunday. Back to my airport Sunday evening, and stay the night by the airport for an early Monday flight. If I could manage the day so an early enough flight got me an afternoon of skiing Saturday, I'd consider that too (eg shorter trip from the airport). 

I'm a pretty good skier, and I can handle pretty much anything we have in New Hampshire/Vermont/Maine for difficulty. I like a day of mixed terrain, but would definitely be okay on mostly groomed stuff if it were less expensive or easier to get to (provided it still has some views). I was looking at St Anton am Arlberg and Saalbach-Hinterglemm, but they both are a bit further away from Zurich/Munich than I'd ideally like to go.

"Extreme Arch Pain with New Boots — Little pain when skiing, LOTS of pain when standing or on lift"," 

Hi all, 

Got new boots last year (Tecnica Conchise 120s)

The boots were quite tight to start out, but have packed out to the extent that they fit almost like a glove at this point. A little heel lift, but overall I am happy with the general way they fit my feet and the performance/ responsiveness I get when skiing with them.

Thew only problem is that I have get intense arch pain on my feet with these boots. The pain in the arches more or less is the front (or closer to my toes) part of the arch. The pain is so intense that I am having to stop a lot and it becomes borderline unbearable at times

A couple other notes:

* I am using Sidas 3 Feet Low arch insoles 
* The pain is absolutely most intense when I take the boots off. My arches become intensely tender and painful
* When I am skiing is when they hurt the least. When I am just standing in them or on a flat slope is when they hurt the most.

Any thoughts on this? I am considering investing in custom insoles to try to alleviate this.",skiing,1576536153,hmidontgetit,True,2019-12-16,1

Possibly the World's Worst Skiier Looking for Advice,"Hi there. Little bit of background: I'm a 22F from Texas, and my brother moved to Colorado a few years ago. Last Christmas, he gifted me all-day ski lessons on Copper Mountain. So in January, I visited and took the lessons. They went fairly well, i fell a lot, but was able to go in a straight line down a learning-bunny slope without wiping out. Then i went and revisited about 3 weeks later to try some green runs.

To say it went poorly is a bit of an understatement. It took me the entire day(almost 5 hours) to get down the easiest baby-but-still-a-green-run once. And we started at the lowest green entrance for it. I eventually let him go ski without me while I got up, skii'd about 10 feet, and fell, all the way down the mountain. I had ski patrol who came over and offered advice, parents asking if I needed to CALL ski patrol to just escort me down the mountain, and countless people help me collect my skiis and poles that flew off my body. The highlight of the trip was I managed to turn twice before wiping out. 

SO my question is this. I'm going to revisit next week and we're gonna go to Keystone. I pretty much will need to have another full day of lessons. BUT he suggested maybe trying snowboarding. I've heard the ""snowboarding is harder to learn but easier to master"" phrase, and people saying you fall more while learning to snowboard. But I dont think its physically possible for me to fall any more than I did while skiing. CAN it be worse? Could I just be ""wired"" to where I'll pick up snowboarding easier? If snowboarding could ACTUALLY be worse for me, I'm afraid I'll break bones or possibly die(not totally kidding).

Rigorous approach to improving my skiing?,"Due to some unique circumstances around my job, I’ll have the opportunity to spend 2 weeks at a resort in February and ski consistently for that period. I would like to make the most of the time to help improve my skiing. What kind of approach would you recommend? Pre-reading? Drills? Lessons? 

To give you some background about me:

Ultimately I’d like to become good enough at skiing to tackle most in-bounds terrain and do some backcountry exploration. No goals for anything extreme.

I am an “ok” snowboarder, I have been snowboarding for 10ish years, 2-5 times per year. I can confidently tackle black and some double black trails across varied conditions. I am self taught, so I am sure there are some big technical gaps.

I’d like to transition to skiing and develop good fundamentals while it is still new. I have skied a few times the last two seasons, and can somewhat translate my snowboarding experience. I can solidly ski blues and groomed blacks. I still have significant deficiencies like a sometimes wobbly uphill ski, poor use of poles, and still limited ability to manage varied conditions (e.g. ice, pockets of snow, steeps).",skiing,1576710292,captaincosmicpants,True,2019-12-18,1

Just to share some background, I’ve been snowboarding for about 3 seasons. I’ve decided to try skiing and I will be taking my first lesson and ride this weekend.

I’ve decided to post here and ask about my Skis and boots. They are from my uncle, who hasn’t used them in “20 years.” Here are some pictures I took of them [K2 Skis](https://imgur.com/a/RO48OIE)

The boots fit great and the bindings appear to still be ok, still snappy and and lock in place in all.

I plan on buying my own skis if I like it, but I wanted to use these first and see if I like it. These would be used for maybe 1-2 runs, just to learn on. Are they still ok for that purpose? Asking out of safety and stuff, I read the sidebar and there were some warnings against using old skis, but idk of these fit the description for skis that would be “too old.”

If they aren’t rideable then no issue, I’ll just rent. But if I can get some runs out of them and save some money, I’m all for it (currently a college student so I’m not made of cash).

Skis lost traveling across countries.,"This may not be the standard post you'd find on here but at this point I'm desperate. Just for context, this holiday break I've flown into Switzerland with plans to ski for 2 weeks. I had two pairs of skis in my ski bag as well as all my outwear gear and boots, and I planned on using my boot-bag as a carryon which would hold my day-to-day clothing. 
My commute to Switzerland was through Alaska airlines (PDX &gt; SEA), Condor (SEA &gt; FRA), and finally Lufthansa (FRA &gt; ZRH). I checked my skis and was told they would be brought through all the way to Zurich.

During my first stop in Seattle I was offered complementary checked-baggage for my boot-bag. I informed them that I already had a ski-bag checked and they assured me it was without charge and both bags would make it to my final destination (Zurich). Upon landing in Zurich I received my boot-bag but my ski-bag with **all** of my ski gear had not made it. I reported this to the service desk and they helped me setup a claim for the ski-bag, they also informed me that it was in the international tracing system and that I would be notified once they located it. It's been several days now and there has been no response on where my ski-bag may have ended up, and each airliner has been running me in circles regarding any questions I have.

I had 2 pairs of skis; one of them brand-new and unridden, as well as my outerwear, boots, and everything else that would keep me warm. I budgeted this trip the best I could and would be unable to rent every piece of gear for 2 weeks. I know that most airliners compensate rentals but they are extremely finicky about prices.

I had my phone number on the side of the ski bag in a clear pouch but have not received a phone call, and now my thoughts are turning to the possibility that someone may have stolen my ski bag from the airport.

I feel like the 1 reason I flew this far is now gone, and the chances of the airport locating my bag are growing slimmer with each passing day. Has anyone had this problem and if so was it ever solved?",skiing,1576766121,unknower17,True,2019-12-19,1

Question about lesson etiquette for instructors,"Hi all. I’m a 22 yo female learning how to ski for the first time. I took a beginners lesson yesterday and totally loved. My instructor gave me her card and said to message her if I had any questions. I was wondering if it would be appropriate to ask if she does shorter private lessons outside of the resort? 

I spent $199 on this beginners lesson and already have a pass for the season and season rental gear, so I really really don’t want to shell out another chunk of change for a more advanced lesson. She said I’m almost good to go but could probably benefit from the last level of beginner lessons (basically chairlift to the longest greens). My main problem was really getting my turns down, but other than that i wasn’t scared at all and was picking it up pretty quick.  I think I would be fine without the extra lesson, but if I can get a bit of extra instruction for less money and time (like 2-3 hours instead of a full day) I would be stoked.   

So would it be okay to ask her about her own lessons off resort time, or is that not okay? I was thinking that was kinda why she gave me her card, but I didn’t wanna misread it.",skiing,1575937035,putabirdonit12,True,2019-12-09,1

Variables:

* My wife will likely only ski greens for a day or two, and then will be looking for some other things to do.

Help! My Ski Boots are So Uncomfortable - even with custom fitting.,"I’m having a lot of issues with getting my boots to fit comfortably and correctly. 

I bought Fischer RC-4 boots and have had them vacuum fit and have gotten 2 different pairs of custom footbeds (and not the cheap ones, like $250 BD 3D race/BD speed). They’ve been molded by bootfitters at a good shop in the SLC area. But, I still feel like my new boots aren’t as good as they should be - and even hurt my feet and can feel very tight around my calves when fastened on. 

The size is right, I’m wearing ski socks, and I’m really looking for some advice on what I can maybe do to make them feel better. Or if I’m missing something. 

The first custom footbeds didn’t give me any arch support in my left foot, and were way worse than the stock footbeds. So, we molded a new pair that fixed the arch support in the left foot. That pair fixed the one foot, but it almost feels like my stance is bowlegged due to the angle of the mold around my right foot. I’m going to try to use the good right foot from the first mold and the good left foot from the second mold to see if that may fix it. But, it’s really frustrating that I’ve done all the right things and the boots actually are worse than the stock fit. 

I have old shitty boots that - aside from a loose fitting left heel - feel to fit better than my brand new, custom fitted boots. I actually took the stock footbeds from the shitty boots and put them in my new boots - and it feels better..

Also, I can’t decide if the boots are fastened too tightly and that’s what causing the pain around my calves. But, if it’s too loose that’s an issue too. My “fix”  has been unclipping the boots on the lift up to get some relief. 

I know this might be hard to understand based on not being able to actually see and feel the boots, but do you have any advice on how I can get a more comfortable fit?

I used to skii a lot when I was younger (till I was 16 or so) but it slowly fell out from my life because of other hobbies and life. Now I am 28 years old and Im getting back to skiing thanks to my girlfriend. I'm fairly skilled skiier and it is all coming back to me quite fast. I have been skiing with my old and overly too short skiis and Im putting up a new setup for this season. 

I was able to get almost unused Salomon MTN Explore 95 skiis for practically nothing from my cousin and Im now looking for bindings to those. My plans are mostly skiing resort for now but maybe going some treks and back countries when I get more used to skiis and be able to get some training and stuff. I could get Marker Dukes for fairly good price. I know that type of bindings are kinda ""Last generation"" but I think they would be quite suited for my needs. Are those bindings any reasonable buy anymore, or are they totally surpassed by Shifts? I am a student so my budget is not limitless. 

TLDR; Are Marker Dukes totally idiotic purchase for returning skiier who would want do some small trekking and back countrying in the future?",skiing,1576060250,MegaSuperKID,True,2019-12-11,1

What I am unsure about is how to adjust the the front piece of the ski so it matches the front part of the boot as well as the forward pressure.

Here are some pictures I took of the skis, I've read some comments online and some youtube videos but I don't see anywhere to adjust the toe part up or down to match my boot. For the forward pressure, 

""the only trick with marker bindings is to make sure the screw that adjusts the heelpiece in the back is flush with the heel piece housing while your boot is in the binding. That will set your forward pressure properly so that your boot will pop out at the right pressure level."" 

I don't see anywhere for this so I am guessing my binding is not a marker binding, is there anywhere or anything I need to adjust for the forward pressure?

AFD Adjustment on Ski Bindings,"Hello,

I recently got some new ski boots (Dalbello Pantera 120), which have GripWalk sole types, and I am wanting to set up the AFD on my skis properly so I don't tear an ACL while on the mountain.  I noticed however on my ski bindings that the AFD plate is a piece that slides to the right and left and people are always saying how around 0.5 mm of space is needed in between the ski boot and this piece.  As a reference, my older ski boots were brought and tested at my local ski shop only about a month prior and I found that when I tested them myself, there isn't even enough room to pull out a thin piece of paper with a thickness of around 0.1 mm.  Are these types of AFD plates safe to have 0 mm of space in between them?  I just couldn't imagine my ski shop giving my ski bindings back to me unsafe.  My skis are currently set at DIN 10 currently as well.  Forward pressure is good and set up properly with the new boots in place.  As a reference, my ski bindings that I am currently talking about are both the Xpress 10 bindings from Rossignol and the XTO 12 bindings from Atomic.

I'm a pretty aggressive skier and I like my skis to stay on when I need them to, but when I'm in a high velocity crash of 60 mph I'm expecting them to come off.  I really appreciate the help.  Thanks.

I would take it to the local shop again but I'm thinking of trading my boots back in anyway to get a Lange pair instead.  Also time is an issue and the local shops are a decent drive to go to.  On top of that, it's a good thing to know how to test them yourself anyway and I would like to know whether my ski bindings are safe or not.

Question About Boots,"Fellow skier(M) here. I'm looking for a new pair of ski boots and I'm facing a dilemma. I can get the 2019 Salomon Ghost FS 100 for around $260 with special discount or get the 2020 K2 BFC 100 for around $400 (2020 Full Tilt Descendant 6 is also an option for the same price but I prefer K2) I could say I'm an advanced level skier and $400 is the maximum I can spend right now for a new pair of boots. I probably won't buy another pair for a few years so I want to make the best purchase for the money, the current boots I own hurt my right ankle a lot, after a few days of skiing with them the pain becomes so severe that it hinders my ability to walk, I'm trying to be extra careful with buying new boots so the same thing doesn't happen again, as far as I know all three of those boots have heat treatable liners (I'm also not 100% sure about that) and I hope that feature will eliminate the discomfort/pain in the right ankle. I own slalom and giant slalom skis, and want to get into freestyle/freeride territory sometime in the future, that's why I'm think more about getting the K2 boots as they seem more all-around.  

This is [the Salmon boot](https://www.xtreme.ge/index.php?id=2263&amp;cid=165&amp;m=132) I'm talking about, it being 2019 model is also my speculation because the site doesn't specify the year of the boot.

Powder alliance. New to Skiing. New to area. Help a lonely newby out.,"So im a traveling nurse who just moved to Yakima WA from St Louis Mo. Ill be doing my first skiing since i was 12.    I have a few questions for Y’all

FIRST:  i know no one.  I work at a tiny hospital with people 3 times my age. How do you meet people on the slopes.  I really want to make friends while im out here. Maybe find a ski buddy who i can hit up for random trips to the slopes whenever.  Also would help to learn some things in the process. QUESTION: ARE THERE ANY GROUPS I CAN JOIN TO MEET PEOPLE.  ONLINE OR IRL. Or is it easy to meet people on the slopes or in the lodge. Not sure how that normally goes down. Ill be going alone everytime i ski

SECONDLY:   I have powder alliance.  Traveling and seeing new places is big for me. I was willing to drive the extra distance to do crystal mountain and IKON pass because of all of the locations and big name slopes.  but i didnt realize they close the mountain passes from one side 🤣 and the drive to crystal would have been 6 hours lol. In 40 min from white pass WA. Im not familiar with 90% of PA locations

I’ve had both miniscus (sp) patched up and worked on about 10 years ago. They were apparently in rough shape. 
I also had my left ACL replaced, or fixed. Whatever they do when they use your hamstring to fix you up. 
The only thing that we could attribute to my knee problems is a quick growth spurt when I was a teenager. Kind of a week explanation. Anyway ...

Now. I don’t mind living with bad knees. But now that I’m living close to the mountains I’m thinking that it would be so fun to get into skiing or skiing or snowboarding. 

I’m in shape and healthy. So I’m wondering if I invest in some intense knee braces, it would be worth it?

How effective are partial twin-tips at skiing switch?,"Looking to treat myself to a new pair of sticks for christmas.

I own a pair of twin tips that are getting pretty beat up at this point. I'm looking for an all-mountain ski that's a little more stiff, and suited for hard tight turns in the moguls. I also ski switch a lot. Unfortunately, it's hard to find full twin tip skis that are also stiff with a tight turning radius, seems like you either have one or the other.

I was looking at a the [black crow camox](https://www.evo.com/outlet/skis/black-crows-camox-2018) but it's a partial twin-tip, which has me a bit worried, since I've been skiing twin-tips since forever. Is this going to be an issue skiing switch at a good pace?

While I do enjoy taking a spin in the park, I'm never going to be landing switch off some massive 40 foot ramp. Sure, I'll do some medium sized 180s/540s now and again, but I'm not taking huge impacts landing backward, which makes me feel like partial twin tips are going to be fine.

So those of you who have ski'd both full twins and partial twins, did you notice a huge difference? Are the partial twins lacking in any aspect, do they tend catch on bumps noticeably more?

Additionally, if y'all have any recommendations for a stiff twin-tip with a tight turning radius, I'd love to hear it. Thanks!",skiing,1575565043,w3nch,True,2019-12-05,1

Help choosing between two hardshell jackets,"Hey all, I'm in the market for a new jacket and have narrowed it down between two options. I wanted to get someone's opinion on which one would be a better buy.

* Actually able to try it on, so I know the fit (fits a little funny but overall not bad)
* Cheaper (slightly)
* Better colors

[Mammut Stoney Hardshell](https://www.mammut.com/us/en/p/1010-26461-1242/stoney-hs-jacket-men/)

* 3 layer construction vs 2 layer on MHW
* More specifications listed (resistance/breathability, features)
* Lots of nice quality features (pockets, removable skirt, good zips)
* NEGATIVE: Unable to try on , so I don't know how it fits, but fairly positive I know my size (body measurements)

Backcountry / touring novice - Equipment advice,"I'm a seasoned skier at 37 years old and have been on the slopes since I was  &lt; 5.

I'm an east coast skier and my primary weapon is a set of Line SFBs. This all started by looking for another ski that would handle hard pack, quick turns, trees, and bumps a bit better. The SFBs handle all of those things pretty well given their size, but they're still a bit beefy on the days I feel like being less of a tank and more of a dancer.

I've also been wanting to get into some light backcountry / touring, but I've never done it before. I was thinking maybe I could kill two birds with one stone. I'll be 90% on piste as that's where my friends are at, but would like the option to tour.

I know I'd need new skis, bindings, and boots. I was hoping I could do this in such a way where everything was interchangeable. Meaning, bindings that would take my current boots AND touring boots. Also getting boots that can be used for touring AND on my current skis. Is this even possible? Then, finally, a pair of skis that are lightweight and nimble but strong enough to handle the icecoast.

Can anyone make some recommendations on 1) is this a pipe dream? and 2) if not a pipe dream, what equipment should I be looking at?

Do you think I will blow up my Subaru?,"Back story: My family of 4 will be embarking on a 14 day ski trip (hitting Monarch, Co, Powder Mountain, UT, Grand Targhee, and Jackson Hole!).  Freakin' stoked!!!!

I have a 2013 Subaru outback with a Yakima roof rack system on-top (Landing pad 13 risers, medium corebar). My normal setup is a fatcat-4 and a rocket box 11 up top.  The fatcat-4 has been good for us as the boys are younger and I could throw their short skis in the back of the subaru and there would be room for my wife and multiple pairs of skis for me on the fatcat.  Now that the boys are older and their skis no longer fit in the back of the car and my wife has multiple pairs of skis too, I've been thinking that I'd like to have another rocket box 11 to hold skis and poles instead of the fatcat-4.  I was thinking one rocket box for dry storage and one rocket box for wet ski storage (6+ pairs of skis).  My buddy is willing to loan me his rocket box for the trip.

Here's my question:  Will I blow up my Subaru by having so much wind resistance up top?

 I already know that she already burns about a 1/2 quart of oil every other fill-up or so when I'm rocking my current set up.  Will the addition of another of another rocket box stress her 4-cylinder engine too much?  I don't want to blow a head gasket.

Adjusting/tuning/waxing skis &gt;5yrs old,"Hi guys, 

I’ll preface this by stating I am not a skier. I like single planking.

My brother is coming to join me in beautiful BC shortly to hit the mountains. 
He is an intermediate skier, but does not own his own. 
Considering we are skiing/boarding for quite a few days, he will be buying new boots when he arrives(better costs than multiple rentals).

Ahead of time, a few months ago I bought some 2008 Atomic Metron B5i Skis that are the right fit for him. They are In good, serviceable condition but need a wax and tune, and will also need the bindings adjusted to his new boots.

I rang a local shop to ask about getting a wax, tune and adjustment and was told that no shop will touch skis/bindings over 5years old due to instability in the spring- a liability issue I am told.

Is there any truth to this? 

Did I waste the $70 on the used Skis? 

Can I just get them waxed and tuned at another shop and attempt to adjust the bindings ourselves?(I’m pretty mechanically minded, can’t be that hard.. right?)

I believe this particular ski combo does not have a removable binding, so cannot simply upgrade the binding.

Because he arrives right around Christmas I was hoping to have them waxed and tuned ahead of his arrival, but certainly don’t want to waste this money if the bindings cannot be adjusted and he ends up buying new/er skis

"How will these skis (165cm twin tips) be for me? 5’10, 200lbs","A little background: I grew up skiing and would have considered myself advanced until a pretty significant head injury in 2011 and I haven’t skied consistently since.

Help! How do I ensure my newb wife enjoys the slopes!,"I love to ski. I look forward to it every winter even though I go max 3-4 days a year it's one of my favorite activities to do hands down. My wife however never went skiing before she met me. I am getting nervous because my first two attempts to take her skiing were disastrous. 

The first time I took her while we were dating to Hunter NY and I took her down a green and let's just say if you take your significant other, who has never put skis on in their life, down a green ""you're gonna have a bad time"". Start on the bunny slopes and maybe ski school. DUH.

Second time I took her skiing with friends for a day, also Hunter NY, I put her and her friend in ski school. She wasn't the biggest fan because it was too slow of a process and not enough personal attention from the instructor, which is understandable.  In the middle of the day I met up with her and on our first run together she started complaining about her boot, which led to her quitting and getting mad at me for ""not caring"". I thought its normal, rental ski boots are not known for comfort. That turned out to be a disaster because one of her toe nails turned black and eventually fell off entirely.

Which brings me to this ski trip. We are going to Utah and I need to do everything in my power to make sure she gets the best experience possible. If she hates it after that, then so be it.

"Hey, all you web devs and software engineers in /r/skiing...","...if any of you have experience writing/designing GUIs, I've got a project that should be pretty easy for you that could make you some quick money if you get IP protection for the finished product. 

I'm over here trying to decide where in the hell I want to ski tomorrow, it's down to WP and Copper because those are my two early season home mountains, but I want to see if either have opened any new trails since I was last there earlier this week. For the first time in a while I've found myself on Copper's god-awful Trail and Lift Status page, found here: https://www.coppercolorado.com/the-mountain/trail-lift-info/winter-trail-report

I ski Copper 20+ times a season, so I know it pretty well...but I still have a seriously miserable time trying to use the information on that page to visualize what the hell is actually open. Even though that's probably the best NON-graphical layout they could have come up with, it's still objectively terrible. 

Then I started clicking around some other mountains' sites...basically ALL the resorts handle their trail and lift status pages like this...they're all absolutely shit and you literally have to pull a map up on a second screen or unfold a physical trail map to cross-reference manually with the status page. 

So, some of you are probably already ahead of me on this, but what I'm thinking is if you could come up with an interactive map tool that could have overlays of every run and lift line that would highlight in different colors for open/closed, that would be a HUGE improvement over the current system. You could probably patent the IP for this and have a pretty easy time selling it directly to resorts or to web dev companies as an embed. Each map would have to be made custom for each resort, but once you've got the core concept polished you could pretty easily set it up so that the resort staffer who updates each resort's site just has to click on the app settings and tick boxes for every trail and lift that's open, and the map will update that way. 

So there you go, I just gave you a way into the ski industry that you can do pretty much completely on your own with very little overhead. You're welcome.

Best skiing experience in Colorado for out of state visitors?,"Breckenridge, Keystone or Copper for out of state skiers that want scenic views?

Hello! My boyfriend and I are from Florida and we are visiting Colorado this week and have one day planned for skiing. We’re both in our early 20’s and beginner level skiers. We’ve only been skiing on the east coast and we’re really looking forward to experience the amazing Colorado skiing we’ve always heard about. So my question is: is Breckenridge really worth all the hype? The price is definitely the highest out of the three but we don’t mind paying the premium if it’s truly worth it and the views will blow our minds🤯 (like I said we’re from Florida so all Mountain View’s are insane to us) 

Regardless of where we ski we are going to spend the night in Breckenridge because I heard the town itself is super cute and has a fun night life, plus they’re all in close ish distance from each other. I heard good things about keystone, copper and Loveland but it seems like it’s more of a local mountain. Are the views there as nice as Breckenridge? What about the overall experience?

Line sir Francis bacon (SFB) 2020 opinions,"Hey My fellow skibums. I desperately need your great wisdom.

I'm looking for some new skis. I'm 183 cm and weigh 78 kgs. I would class my self as an advanced skiier. I tend to ski about 35% piste, 50 % off-piste and 15 % park. I love to play/jibb on my skis and do butters, jump/spin and so forth. I also really like to ski trees and moguls. 

I think the new 2020 line SFB seems like a good fit for me. I've tried the nordica enforcer 110 and black crows atris last season and while both these skis were fun and great skis, I thought they were too stiff to press for manuals and butters. I'd much rather sacrifize some stability for more playfulness!

You think I should go for the SFB? Anyone tried it? Should i go for 190 or 184 cm? Feel like moguls and swing weight would be negatively impacted by the 190 cm, but on the other hand it would offer more stability? Anyone other skis you would recommend?

HELP - ski coat stolen- recommendations for replacement?,"I have been skiing for 10 years and basically bought a new jacket every year in search of the ""perfect"" coat. That search came to an end last year when I came across my unicorn. The North Face Anonym GoreTex. It checked all of the boxes and came in ALL BLACK. Super stylish so that you could wear it on the mountain and out at night in town if you were traveling so I wouldn't need to bring two coats. Unfortunately, on one of my trips recently, I brought the coat out with me to dinner/drinks and someone stole my coat from the coat check. Thankfully it was our last night and the place gave me money to compensate me, but I can't find this damn coat anywhere. They do have a newer model but it is not the same and has all of the logos and zippers in white which IMO does not look very good.

Basically this jacket, in all black:
https://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-anonym-hooded-jacket-mens

-waterproof
-slim fit
-stretchy
-goggle pocket inside chest
-removable hood (fits over helmet)
-stretch snow skirt
-wrist pocket for goggle wipe

If you could find the all black version in Large, I would owe you my first born child. Otherwise, a comparable jacket would be great. I've looked at a couple of HH and AT jackets, but nothing really comes close to the style aspect. Do you guys know of any all black jackets that check these boxes?

First experience to Skiing this weekend at 30yo... This sport is way too expensive for the common man.,"Hey guys joined this sub because I want to share my opinion on my first experience skiing.

I’m 30yo, grew up in Texas(non existent skiing). I’ve always been fascinated with winter sports. Wife is from Great Lakes and no stranger to snow. 

We decided spur of the moment to go to Mammoth Lakes recently to ski. We saw forecast for like 36” of snow. 

I want to love the sport. I see myself absolutely loving it. But from the 6 hour drive to get here, the absurd costs of a lift ticket for my family and 3/4 of the lift closed, having to buy snow gear for everyone, plus cost of lodging for 2 nights.... no way man. 

I loved the town, the village, all white powder, but the costs were absurd. This sport is exclusively for the wealthy and those privileged enough to grow up near ski resorts. The mere thought of getting lessons at my age made my wallet cringe even more. 

I make good money as a pilot, wife does well too. But how is this sport sustainable? How does the common man, who didn’t grow up near the slopes, and makes a modest income, learn to ski? 

I hope to be able to learn one day, I know I’d love it... but I got bills to pay. 

As ski people, what is being done to curb this? 

TLDR; rookie adult tries skiing with high hopes. Way too expensive and wants to know how it’s a sustainable economy.",skiing,1575097310,igloojam,True,2019-11-30,1

Ski Size Question - 184cm for a 6 foot tall !Male,"Hi Everyone,

I just ordered some 2019 Volkl 90eight skis at 184cm. Some of my friends said they may be a little long. I'm wondering if anyone has an opinion or has purchased a longer ski than you were used to. Here are some stats on me. I'm 29 btw.

Current Ski - Line Supernatural 92, 179cm (cracked last season. Can't be repaired)

Height: 6 feet

Weight: 180lbs. Slim

Skier Level: Advanced-Expert. Been skiing for 22 years. 

I hear longer skis provide a lot more stability but are harder with short turns. On groomers I do really wide, fast turns with ease and I think these will be amazing. My only worry is when I'm skiing off-trail with my expert friends. We typically ski at Whistler Blackcomb and I've become very used to making quick last second turns to avoid obstacles. I'm hoping the additional 5cm won't make life on the mountain a lot harder. Always hard to find the perfect ski while shopping online. I live in Los Angeles currently, and there aren't many ski stores that have great deals. I picked between the 90eights and the M5 Mantra's. I went for the Black Friday deal I found. Did I make the right choice? Or should I make a change to the size and/or model?

Do I have to ski with poles?,"Hello my snow sliding friends I hope all of your seasons are started and going well. 

I am an intermediate-advanced skier. Cautiously doing black and double black trails, and woods skiing. I'm an aspiring free rider and park rider, trying tiny kickers wherever I can and venturing off into woods terrain.


Last year I had my poles stolen in March. I never replaced them, just skiid without, and realized that I really, really enjoy skiing without poles! Less stuff to carry around and keep track of, and I love having the freedom with my hands. I have 0 issue skating out flats or climbing up hills. Didn't think anything of it till this season started. I got a job as an instructor at a local hot spot and everyone I've met on the snow says something along the lines of ""no poles??"" ""Don't believe in poles?"" ""You gotta get some poles"" and I mean everyone! Colleagues, friends, strangers, anyone I meet on my skis.

I don't think my technique has been compromised since I ditched them, in fact each of the 6 times I've been on my skis this season I have been super impressedd with myself and noticed improvements where I have been striving to improve. People are starting to get to me though. Am I missing something with the poles? I intend to use them when I teach lessons as i wanna be on par with the lesson structure of the whole mountain, but I feel like people think I am and idiot or something skiing around with my free hands.",skiing,1575150929,aclhiker8,True,2019-11-30,1

i think i’d like to spend the month in one place, rent an apartment or something, get in a [monastic] routine, and as an extra bonus would be reallllly into somewhere that wouldn’t require a car. i have access to one if needed but not needing one would be preferable.

Hi, I had to leave an awesome day early today after towards the end of my day I had started getting cramps in my quads. Actually, it’s more like vulgar twitches that causes each little “muscle”/striation in my quad to alternately contract strongly and can be quite painful. I’m thinking it’s due to exhaustion but what is troubling me is that I didn’t actually feel all that exhausted. The cramps tired my legs out significantly and after a bit of skiing they’d start again.

Replacing my perfect wind resistant jacket,"For almost 15 years I have loved my [REI Syncro](https://www.rei.com/product/698506/rei-co-op-syncro-jacket-mens) jacket. It's basically a full-zip Denali lookalike but it's made of stretch-woven Polartec Wind Pro (60 CFM) instead of 300 and it's got thinner side panels that make it a little cooler. It's 22 ounces. It is now embarrassing to wear because stains. I still wear it, but it's embarrassing. **Can you help me find my new favorite wind-resistant jacket?**

I'd rather not have an argument about wind resistance. I like  ""useless"" mid-range CFM jackets. Low CFM is too warm, high CFM may as well be a T-shirt.

Criteria seem to be:

* Full zip
* Wind resistant but not wind proof (no membrane)
* Comfy (pebbled or curly fleece) inside
* All or mostly  fleece outside (Denali-style panels are okay)
* Prefer (but getting desperate so...)
   * No hood
   * Smooth (not pebbled or curly) fleece outside

I use this for skiing when it's not too rainy (after that I add a shell) and knocking about San Francisco, New York, or Pittsburgh when it's chilly but above freezing.

In terms of materials, nobody seems to make jackets out of Wind Pro anymore. Windbloc (0 CFM), WindStopper (1 CFM), Power Shield Pro (2 CFM), Power Shield Pro (7 CFM), and WindWall 2 (10 CFM) don't seem breathable enough. Polartec Power Stretch might be right but it's marketed as ""Value Oriented"" so I can't tell if it will hold up. WindWall 1 (40 CFM) might be right but I can't find much about it and am not a huge fan of North Face.

I don't *think* I want a Denali -- it sounds like it's much warmer (but I could be wrong because the total weight is similar). The [EMS Divergence](https://www.ems.com/ems-mens-divergence-fleece-jacket/1282361.html) seems about right but also is no longer made.

My theory is that applying a carnauba based wax to the top sheet will do two things.

The other more functional aspect is that water/snow will sheet off more easily so less wipe down is needed when transporting skis.

So I’ve been unable to get enough of my buddies to come skiing with me on a trip this winter so I’m planning a solo skiing trip.

Ski Length charts all Suck.,"Curious about detailed thoughts on Ski Length! All over the internet are charts of what length your ski should be for your height, but they don't seem to take weight into consideration. 

They also all seem to be wrong in the same way-- at 6'2"" I'm told I need a ski between 175-195, or between my chin and top of my head. My chin is 166cm and top of head is 188cm. . . Eye level is about 178cm. Eye level seems like it would be the perfect compromise, but everywhere tells me 178cm would be a beginners length for my height.

Then there is effective edge, tip/tail rocker etc. that never seem to go into any of these equations.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

Tldr;

Right now I have an old pair of these ([https://www.evo.com/outlet/skis/salomon-scream-pilot-10-hot-bindings-2004](https://www.evo.com/outlet/skis/salomon-scream-pilot-10-hot-bindings-2004)) in 175 and I really like how easy it is to turn, but it definitely feels less stable and too short for my height (6'2""). 

I also have a 188 Soul 7, which due to the tip and tail rocker seems to have the same effective edge as the shorter ski, but it feels too difficult to work and I don't really like it. Perhaps this is more due to the weight of the larger ski and the wider waist width of 106 rather than the 188 length though. 106 for my ability level at a resort with 75% groomers 25% off trail is terrible. I'm going to save them for very deep snow. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ask because I am considering a new ski, Black Crows Captis ([https://www.evo.com/skis/black-crows-captis](https://www.evo.com/skis/black-crows-captis)), and am trying to decide between the 178 and 184 lengths. It has twin tip rocker, but seems to still have have a pretty decently long effective edge / planing surface, eyeballing it looks longer than my two other skis even at the 178. But the manufacturer suggests 184, in one of these vague and frustrating charts I've been complaining about.",skiing,1575429731,stupid_butthead,True,2019-12-03,1

Does anyone have any experience with POC goggles? Having trouble deciding which to get if any at all.

Are the lenses easy to change? Are the comp versions worth it, or do the vents in the non-comp version actually make them better for a non-competitive skier? The Orb Clarities also look awesome, but I am worried about the lens changes (both because each one is very expensive, and also because changing lenses changes the color of the goggle/strap which is kind of annoying).

I'm looking to pick up my second pair of boots ever this year and it will be a substantial upgrade from my atomic prime 110s. I weigh 220lbs and I am a ski instructor. I know how to point em and I like to ski bumps and steeps.

I am looking at boots like the speedmachine 130, but the boot shop recommended I check out crossover boots like the strider 130. I'm into the idea because having a walk mode would be nice, but I'm not actually doing any touring.

I have heard that these crossover boots tend to have a ""stop"" in the flex where it stops feeling progressive and just feels hard.  Is this true?  It seems odd to me that the speedmachine is the same price as the strider.",skiing,1574687473,stay_janley,True,2019-11-25,1

2. **Is it easy to remove and reinstall the bindings?** It looks pretty simple online, but I’m concerned because other traditional advice says to only let professionals install them. Am I fine if I just put them back in place?

3. **Ive seen “ski wraps” online.. but I’m skeptical how those would hold up from experience with auto wrap. Any thoughts here?

4. **Anything else I should consider?**",skiing,1574867677,Duke-Silv3r,True,2019-11-27,1

Ski lessons as an (experienced) adult... Worth it? Tips/advice?,"Hoping you guys can help provide a little insight regarding ski lessons! Maybe you have taken lessons in a similar situation or even been an instructor. 

I started skiing when I was a kid, but haven't had a lesson in probably 20 years. I've been wanting to take a short private ski lesson to help get more comfortable and smoother in certain situations. Maybe get some tips and some things to work on.

I'd say I'm no longer intermediate but not nearly an expert. I'll ski pretty much anything in bounds and am okay with small drops, heavy glades, etc. My main goal is to improve smoothness and be better at staying in a good rhythm while at speed on more challenging terrain. 

Can an afternoon ski resort lesson help with this? What should I be looking for? I'm just not sure what to expect after talking to them on the phone. When they described the lesson ability levels, they were all very basic. Anything beyond doing parallel turns on blues just all gets lumped into their advanced class.

Are lessons really only meant for true beginners, or can more experienced people also get value from lessons? What should I be looking for?

I was stoked to take lessons this season, but am now having second thoughts. Any advice would be appreciated!",skiing,1574873693,voteharvey,True,2019-11-27,1

Anyway, I had a thought. Since I don't know much about park, I was wondering if it is possible to do a grind with your ski pulls; or if anyone has ever done it. And yes, I am talking about diving at a rail, head first, and landing on it with your pull(s). 

I would think the mentality would doing like a superman front flip, and in the process, having a rail on or near the landing where you could tap/grind it with your pulls before completing the flip.

Another way could be by just having really good core strength and forcing your skis back under you after doing the grind.",skiing,1574879755,LargeCatNipples,True,2019-11-27,1

* Is a base layer and regular chinos enough while not skiing

"Picking out new skis, Please Help!","Hi all, 
I am a skier who makes it up to Colorado to ski about 10 days a year, and I’m finally ready to pull the trigger on my first pair of skis. I’ve been skiing for 15 years, but I’ve always rented demos.

I also rode a pair of Salomon Rocker2 100s a few years back and liked those, too. I’ve heard some feedback that the Factions have had some problems with durability, and I definitely want something that’s going to last me a few seasons at least.

Any help would be greatly appreciated on what skis I should get!! I want to make sure I make a good decision on something that will perform well in packed and semi-powdery conditions, and is a good all mountain ski for an advanced skier. Thanks in advance! 

Oh, also bindings. I have no idea what to get here. I have a pair of boots that I love, so just need some bindings for the skis and I’ll be set.",skiing,1575055787,southerncullen,True,2019-11-29,1

* Good place for ""amateurs"", some of us have gone a few times ( 5 times tops) skiing, and ski from maybe green to black diamond, but there will probably be some guys who haven't gone skiing at all.
* Some night life, some bars/ restaurants to go to at night would be fun... extra points if there's a night club.

* Nice accomodation options, we would like to have different options on hotels, cabins and maybe even airbnbs for about 8-12 persons.

Not a MUST but it could be very nice if:

* Has some betweeen the trees routes, in Breckenridge, Colorado we found out there were some between the tree routes in the some green courses and we had a blast taking those routes.",skiing,1574207261,Guaminator18,True,2019-11-19,1

Relationship between actual foot width and boot last width,"Of course I will go to a bootfitter when the time is right for my next pair. I've been to many already and will continue to seek their advice and pay for their services. But in the meantime, I'm curious and would like to conduct an informal survey.

Obviously it depends on the volume of your foot (arch height and actual thickness) and the volume and density of your liners and the kind of fit you like, but would you care to share: 

1. your [foot width](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1231/0842/files/foot_measurement_guide_1024x1024.jpg?v=1502846593)
2. [foot circumference](https://i.imgur.com/lsBh6Us.png) at the heads of the metatarsals
3. type of liner you use
4. boot model &amp; boot last, assuming your boots fit you well?

I ask because the last bootfitter I went to told me that just like basically anything else about them, boot last widths aren't comparable between manufacturers. He said that in his experience, Lange boots are always wide and recommended I look into Dalbello (Kypton, I think) and Nordica boots as they are more consistently as narrow as they say they are.

~110mm all mountain suggestions?,"I'm currently perusing some Black Friday deals to replace my 188cm Black Crows Daemons (2 ski quiver with 93mm Orbs, just didn't think they were different enough).  6'1"" 200lbs advanced skier, likes ripping turns on piste and boucing around off it.

Can currently see some really good deals on the 18/19 188cm Corvus, 179cm 104 Sick Day and 185cm Enforcer 110.

Any suggestions for which way to go?

My thought process: Orbs are fantastic on piste and will probably be used 75% of the time, thus the second ski should be more powder oriented (this is where I didn't think the Daemons were different enough).

1. Corvus - new flagship Black Crows ski last year.  I saw one comment that ""this is what the Daemon should have been all along"".  Slightly more expensive.
2. Sick Day - may be too short/weak, but supposed to be a lot of fun and could be a 50/50 ski with a shift (have Lange XT 130s)
3. Enforcer 110 - seems to be the darling of all review websites, for good reason?  Most powerful of the 3? Also the cheapest.

Should we just get her nice skis now?  I am confident that she will become a life long skier, she loves it, she knows I love it and she wants our future kids to love it.    Should we get a cheap pair of skis and wait for her to progress before making a serious investment?

What is a seasonal average?,"Whats up powderhounds. This is just a friendly reminder of what averages are and are not. Published average snowfall amounts are not minimum expectations or entitlements. If your area gets 400 inches of snow a year that doesn't mean you should expect 400 inches of snow this year. It doesn't mean that 400 inches is the minimum that you should expect or that you are entitled to.  

It simply means that historically speaking your resort has observed somewhere above and below that number. (I cant believe I have to say this) Over a long period of time each seasons snowfall is added together and then divided by the total seasons in the dataset. Your expectations should be calibrated to support a number below 400 inches. Because of this there will be years that your resort gets below the average and other years will miraculously receive above. This will flip year over year. 

Years that you get below 400 inches are not ""bad"" or ""abnormal"" years by any scientific or academic sense. Years that you get above 400 inches are not ""good"" or amazing years. That isn't how averages work. You will always get above or below. You will rarely get the average. Furthermore you cannot compare a single season's snowfall from region to region as every region, or micro region, will receive above or below their average. That means that sometimes billy's resort might get more snow than bob's, and vise versa. Comparing long-term averages and trends is more relevant. Comparing day to day snowfall amounts from region to region is also silly. It doesn't snow everywhere at once. 

I want to re-iterate the good year bad year thing. Getting above your average does not mean you had a good year. Getting below your average does not mean you had a bad year. Having a good or bad year falls on you alone to make the best of the days you get out. Tear your ACL on a deep year? Bad  year then. Ski a new big mountain line or learn to flip on a relatively lower-tide year? Good year then.

Furthermore and side note, comparing, observing, and analyzing early season Snowpack and SWE, in November, between different regions, using averages as a baseline, demonstrates an embarrassing lack of  understanding in regional snowfall patterns and basic arithmetic. 

Maybe.. Uhh.. don't skip class this year to ski when your math teacher teaches averages. Unless it is deeeep. Then skip.",skiing,1574368441,akindofuser,True,2019-11-21,1

Then, I moved to a major city, far from any major resorts and realized the true cost of a ski trip. The direct flights were always priced at a premium, lift tickets were out of control (unless you purchase an Ikon or Epic pass), and lodging is naturally expensive but expected. Meanwhile, my experience to Europe was quite different. Some of Europe's biggest airports have easy access to the Alps, like Milan, Zurich and Geneva. And because these airports deal with a lot of competition, you can find some pretty good deals, especially in the winter. Once you're there, transportation is relatively easy, usually with several bus or train options. Then once you're there, I found that the day to day expenses of food and drink wasn't as high as I anticipated. Yes, Europe can be expensive. But it's not American ski resort expensive where a granola bar can set you back $5. If anything, there was a small premium to dine on the mountain or directly at the base compared to other spots in town but it never felt egregious. 

So... that's the backstory on my experience and the following is some context on the numbers. I ran a quick comparison of two destinations that I thought would offer similar experiences for a family of four traveling from the East Coast of the US. As you'll note, the airfare is quite expensive and could be cheaper to fly to Denver or Salt Lake City but I choose Jackson Hole because I think it's the most similar to Europe's ski experience. Naturally, this is just my opinion and subject to debate. From there, I did my best to try to objectively find similar offerings across each expense. Accommodation was probably the trickiest but I managed to find a two bedroom condo with shuttle access to each resort. Then for rentals, I simply used the information provided by each resort to calculate these expenses for a 7 day period. With more research, I'm sure you can find better values at each. But these are just the figures provided via their websites. For transportation I found a shuttle bus from Zurich to St Anton and priced a taxi from Jackson's Hole airport to the condo's location. Lastly, for the lift tickets, I again used the info provided on the resort's homepages to price out these expenses. Like the rentals, I'm sure you can find some discounts at either location. Additionally, as I mentioned above, the Ikon pass could factored in as well if this hypothetical family of four chooses to ski at an Ikon location more than once this winter. But for the sake of comparison, I used the multi-day prices. 

Anyway, I thought this was an interesting exercise to quantify the differences across the main expenses. As mentioned, I think the food and beverage costs would be a wash, but that could vary between countries. Switzerland is far more expensive than Italy, etc. Additionally, there are some intangible factors to consider as well. Like the culture, impact of jet-lag, and environmental impacts (ie carbon emissions flying more than twice the distance to Europe).

Is there anything wrong with using a 135 ski as an adult?,"This will be my third season skiing. I'm 5'4, 125lb, 26 (female). I've always used a 135 ski (which I know is for children).

The 135s I feel like I can whip however I want. I'm also not a huge speed demon and doubt I ever will be. I'd consider myself an intermediate at this point, I'm fairly confident on West coast blues. I want to buy skis because I'm sick AF of the long lines to rent them, and then the boots are always hit or miss. But when I tell people I want 135s for Christmas, everyone is like ""no you cantttt get those size skis, trust ussss"". -____-

Why I ski (revised 2019),"I've been skiing religiously for the past 25 years with the exception of the 3 or so years between the time we had our first son (12 yo now) and when he was able to start to enjoy skiing.  My wife and 10 yo son ski also but not with the same rabid enthusiasm 12 yo and I do.  It works out wonderfully, I have someone to venture off into the glades with (read: someone to call ski patrol for me) and the Mrs. has a lodge/hot tub buddy when the weather isn't ""perfect"".   


Over the years my reasons for skiing have varied greatly.  It started in high school as a social thing to do with friends.  It became a healthy hobby I could enjoy between fall and spring sports seasons.  In college it became an obsession and an outlet.  In early adulthood it symbolized freedom and an escape from responsibility.


Recently I have discovered what the next phase is for me.  For a few years now I have been sort of just going through the motions when it came to skiing.  I still love it but my body is not able to perform as it once did.  My heart is still in it but the rush I once felt is harder to achieve due to the physical limitations of getting older and the reality of providing for a family lurks in my mind preventing me from skiing at the limits nowadays.


Lately my 12 yo and I have been skiing together a lot and slowly this new experience has rejuvenated me - his obsession with skiing really hasn't left me with much choice.  The issue now is that he has begun to outski me (by a substantial margin) which now poses new challenges.


Last weekend - around 12 or so runs in - we found ourselves at the top of a blue cruiser absolutely buried in man-made fluff.  The temps have been pretty cold - especially at higher elevations - and the result has been a lot of actually enjoyable artificial ""powder"".  


As an aside - to say my son despises cruiser trails is a bit of an understatement.  He is full of youthful ignorance and piss and vinegar and only death-defying acts will satisfy his thirst for stupidity.  He would have much rather been flying down the adjacent black diamond trail covered in snowgun generated whale-backs that had begun to ice up on their steep undulating faces, the trail with the foreboding (or alluring depending on your personal viewpoint) orange sign that read ""ungroomed, experts only!"".  In fairness we did have some fun lively turns there earlier in the day when the snow was fresh but my old, early season legs were ready to give out in protest at this point.  I understood that I needed to keep going for him and he realized that he needed to keep his mouth shut and take whatever I could muster.  We had silently reached a gentleman's agreement on the way up the lift.


So there we stood, at the top of this blue cruiser.  The middle of the trail was quite skied off but the edges were perfectly soft powder piles that made it feel like you were a 6 year old jumping from hotel bed to hotel bed and landing on a pile of supple pillows with each leap.     


The icy middle had forced most of the beginners back to the safe confines of the lodge and we found ourselves almost alone staring at the perfect opportunity for an all out assault on what is usually the ""slow skiing zone"".  We had similar thoughts simultaneously because before I could say anything he smirked at me and took off down the moderate pitch.  I trailed behind him for a few turns and I was empowered by his gleeful (albeit maniacal) laughter.


By the time I was able to catch up to him my initial thought was to blow by him and goad him into a race but as we continued down side by side, each of us enjoying the sensation of flying through the powder piles on either side of the wide trail, I felt so alive.  It was like a scene ripped straight from a Warren Miller film where the tandem on the screen was perfectly synchronized.  I felt such joy and pride that I was able to experience that with my son, for a brief moment everything aligned and we were able to enjoy something together on the same level.


And, as it turned out, that moment was very brief.  By the time we had reached the bottom it was clear to both of us that my body was quitting for the day and he just rolled his eyes and chuckled as he sped off towards the singles line and I headed for the nearest place to sit down.   


My intense love for skiing had not died, it was lying dormant, waiting for moments like this.  I don't know what skiing (or parenting) looks like for me moving forward over the next 5, 10, 15, (20?) years but what I do know is that I'm going to enjoy the hell out if it while I still can.  Whatever that looks like.",skiing,1574434958,carrierpigeon,True,2019-11-22,1

Overweight issues for first time skiier - Advice needed,"Hi,

We are visiting Ruka in Finland in January and I've had some health issues which despite my gym visits and salads has stunted me losing weight. I've lost some but I'm still at 280 pounds. This would be my first time skiing and I would be attending beginners lessons.

My partner adores skiing and would like to go every year so I'm concerned about my first experience hating it if I feel uncomfortable rather than waiting and enjoying it but I don't know if I'm just being silly.

Ski test notes for ~40 pairs of 19/20 skis,"Good people of r/skiing! I submit for your perusal and reference: my notes on the nearly 40 pairs of skis I got to demo last year. I know many folks have made ski purchase  decisions already, but for you fence straddlers: maybe my notes can push you over the edge. You may not agree with my notes. For example, I genuinely dislike the Bonafide, which is one of the most popular skis of all time. People like skiing for different reasons. I split my notes into four sections: powder, all-mountain wide, all-mountain narrow, and piste skis. I found exceptional skis in each category. It’s a good year to be a skier.

Notes on Tester:  
I’m 6’1”, 170 lbs, 34 yo. I get most of my ski days in north Lake Tahoe, Mammoth, and Utah. I work in a small ski shop. My tastes in skis definitely reflects my bias: I like heavy and especially metal skis because they cope better with our beloved Sierra snow. I don’t get as much time on independent ski brands as I would like - something I hope to change. I try to acknowledge my bias while still highlighting the virtues of skis I write about. 

### Powder Skis (110+ mm waist)

The powder ski! The ski you save for those special days! The ski that keeps you up at night knowing that your body and spirit will transcend time and space through this sacred instrument! Most people associate their powder skis with the best times, and I’ll make the argument that most “quiver of one skis” fall apart when faced with 12”+ of fluff. So do the right thing and consider adding one of these to your lineup!

Blizzard Spur  
Length: 192  
Test Location: Heavy sierra powder day at Mammoth Mountains, Snowbasin \~15” powder day  
The Spur is in a category by itself, which is apparent just by looking at the asymmetrical cut. Insane float, a unique blend of sturdy and surfy. I found it easy and reliable at any speed, though it did have a tendency to get hooked on the heavy pow. In blower, the Spur would be an effortless dream. I found it easier to manage than the Nordica Enforcer Pro and the Dynastar Proto, a little more turn-y and fun than those skis, which excel at charging down gnarly terrain.

Blizzard Rustler 11  
Length: 188 and 192  
Test Location: Heavy sierra powder day at Mammoth Mountain, Mammoth January Storm (windblown powder), Alpine Meadows March storm (4” of cream on top of 12” of Sierra cement)  
The Rustler 11 has been a favorite of mine all season. I went up to the 192 today to push the limits of this very versatile ski. I continue to think that this is the perfect resort powder ski. It enables me to attack everything from fresh lines to tracked pow. It can rip around on groomers getting back to the lift. For a metal ski, it has a fantastic ooey-gooey interface with soft snow. Some testers fault the rustler for lacking snappy response on groomers, and I’ll acknowledge that it does not have the race-bred super G feel that you might find in an Enforcer 110. But I still think it's the best ski in the category. It's versatile and approachable for a ski this wide, and I never lacked float. It's essentially three skis in one: a super fun surfy pow ski, a surprisingly clean and nimble carver, and an end of day or leftover crud buster. I now own this ski. 

Armada ARV116 JJ  
Length: 187  
Test Location: Alpine Meadows, what looked to be a powder day turned into cement with 2” of cream on top.  
I was excited to take out this legendary ski for the first time, knowing that it would be a different beast altogether from other skis in the category. I was thrilled with the experience, and felt that the JJ provides a unique surfy / smeary experience that I absolutely loved. I would love to get it out in deeper snow sometime, where those qualities would really shine. Still, I was pleased and impressed with how the ski did while cruising groomers back to the lift. This ski skis a little short - would have liked to try the 192 (and I’m 6’1” // 170 lbs).

Armada Tracer 118  
Length: 188  
Test Location: Heavy sierra powder day at Mammoth Mountain  
I was impressed by how much this ski liked speed. I think it makes great sense as a hybrid resort / backcountry ski for the skier who likes speed. It floats great, but I found it a little sloppy on edge hold, at least in heavy (wet) Sierra pow. May have been the conditions, but other skis were handling better. I loved the graphics. I would give it another shot on different snow. 

Armada Declivity X  
Length: 192  
Test Location: Heavy sierra powder day at Mammoth Mountain  
Surprise hit for me. I thought it would be a big mountain high speed tool, but found it to be surprisingly accessible and versatile. Close call with the Rustler 11, these were my two favorite resort powder skis. At 115mm waist, a wonderful dedicated powder ski. I look forward to riding it again sometime.

Armada ARG 133  
Length: 187  
Test Location: Heavy sierra powder day at Mammoth Mountain  
This was a huge treat to test, and I think I kept it out longer than any other ski in the somewhat epic blizzard conditions at Mammoth. Like the Blizzard Spur, this is a purpose-built ski. And that purpose is spraying face shots all over the mountain. I found the ARG to be great at short cuts and yet still stable when I pointed them out. Of the pure powder skis, this was my favorite. 

Nordica Enforcer Pro  
Length: 191  
Test Location: Heavy sierra powder day at Mammoth Mountain  
I've been a huge fan of the enforcer line for some time, but never got to try the pro / 115. It feels like an enforcer for sure. It's a big ski for sure. I would love to take this ski to Alaska. I love that it can mow down chop. It certainly rails on groomers. But...I'm not sure this ski really makes sense for people who aren't pro skiers. Although it's fun on groomers, it's not much more fun than other powder skis, and it's more of a chore in tight spots. I think I learned something about how Enforcers win a lot of awards: the skis nail a lot of the evaluation criteria. But that doesn't always translate to fun. And in the case of a powder ski, railing groomers is beside the point. 

Dynastar Proto  
Length: 189  
Test Location: Mammoth WWSRA Demo Days  
I tested this ski right next to the Enforcer Pro, and overall I preferred it as a powder ski. They are both high speed float masters, and I suspect they both will be most at home charging steep lines where you need to point'em out. I found the Proto to be a little planky, but nevertheless it was surprisingly agile and nimble. I found myself hopping turns more than slarving or smearing, but I still charged down the hill with confidence, even in tight corners. The Proto got my vote for a high speed pow ski, but the Rustler 11 and the Declivity were more accessible and well rounded. 

Salomon QST 118  
Length: 192  
Test Location: Snowbasin Demo Days  
I enjoyed the QST 118, and I wouldn't have a hard time selling it. It carves nicely. It floats beautifully. Lots of rocker, decently stiff tail. I could imagine falling in love when skiing it in heroic conditions, but I could say the same about a lot of skis. 

Head Kore 117   
Length: 188  
Test Location: Snowbasin Demo Days  
The 117 feels like the most different ski in the Kore lineup. With almost no camber, this ski is buttery and quick at lower speeds or in deeper snow. The ski felt a little less grippy and solid as compared to other Kores, or even other skis in this category, which makes a lot of sense for this ski. In the end, I like this ski a lot for somebody who wants a pivoty pow ski that can handle a little speed, but not too much. As with other Kore skis, I’ll continue my complaint that they are in fact too light. Utah skiers may disagree. 

Atomic Bent Chetler 120  
Length: 192  
Test Location: 2+ foot dump at Mammoth Mountain, storm day with high winds  
Having previously tried (and disliked) the Bent Chetler 100, I wasn’t sure how I would like the 120. It turns out to be a much better shape and size for this style of playful, surfy construction. I struggled a bit with the forward stance, though that can probably be blamed on the heavier Sierra snow I skied that day. Floatation is obviously in a league of its own, and for the skier who has the good fortune to score deep powder, the Bent Chetler is the perfect surfy, playful feel that encapsulates the carefree fun of skiing in powder. For me personally, I still need my powder ski to hold up for afternoon leftovers, and I felt the 120 was a little too light for that. I do love the idea of using this as a touring setup, where fresh powder is almost endless. Makes a great all-purpose powder ski if you don’t want to fly with a downhill and backcountry setup when you fly to Japan.

Fishcer Ranger 115 Fr  
Length: 188  
Test Location: 2+ foot dump at Alpine Meadows  
Hats off to Fischer for their Fr lineup. They managed to marry the crisp, round carve of their race lineage with a ski that surfs, slashes, and pivots. I really enjoyed the 115, and have wondered if maybe I would have preferred it over my very beloved Rustler 11. I plan to revisit this ski again. 

### All-Mountain Wide (99-109 mm waist)

Probably the most versatile category for folks in the North American West. I like all-mountain wide skis a lot because you can pretty much grab one without looking at the forecast - or knowing what terrain you will end up riding - and still have a great time. These skis have to balance fun and float with precision and power. A tall order - but there are a ton of fantastic options this year.

Nordica Enforcer 104 Free  
Length: 185  
Test Location: Heavy sierra powder day at Mammoth Mountain, Snowbasin Demo Days  
Fantastic, accessible, carves and smears. Exactly what Nordica needed to add. Enough float for any Sierra powder day. Abundant fun factor. I tried it both at Mammoth, where it was fun and smeary, and at Snowbasin, where it transitioned between fluffy stashes and dusty but firm groomers with ease. A+ ski. If I could only own one ski next year, this would be it. Highly recommend for the energetic, confident skier who wants one ski that does it all. 

Salomon QST 106  
Length: 188  
Test Location: Heavy sierra powder day at Mammoth Mountain  
This ski surprised me. It immediately made me feel like I was one with the snow. The balance felt perfect from the first turn. It was easy to get on edge and its carving accuracy was fantastic. I skied it in the 188, and was surprised how easy it was. I would guess that intermediate skiers would enjoy this ski a lot. That being said, I skied with some expert skiers at Snowbasin who were ripping on the 106 without a problem. Considering conditions, I thought it was wonderful for the heavier pow. 

Dynastar Legend 106  
Length: 188  
Test Location: Heavy sierra powder day at Mammoth Mountain  
Although by no means a bad ski, the Legend 106 did not stand out in its category, which is filled with a lot of compelling options. I found it to be more fun and forgiving than I expected, but I was really thrown by the tail, which felt loose and wiggly in the soft stuff. I probably would love this ski on firm snow and high speeds, and I might reach for this for more expert skiers, but I had more fun on the Salomon QST 106 and the Nordica Enforcer 104. I thought I would have preferred the Legend, which has a remarkably stiff hand flex. But the swimmy tail was very unusual and did not excite me. 

Salomon QST 99  
Length: 181  
Test Location: Heavy sierra powder day at Mammoth Mountain  
Overall I liked this ski and I think it will sell very well. At 99 mm, there were better skis for the blizzard conditions. Nevertheless I found the QST to provide adequate float. It was fun and easy to ski, and would be very accessible for intermediate skiers. It didn't grab on to the heavy and somewhat wet snow. It also got knocked around a bit. But a lot of users will love this ski as an all mountain daily driver that has plenty of fun and forgiveness. 

Blizzard Rustler 10  
Length: 180 and 188  
Test Location: Heavy sierra powder day at Mammoth Mountain, Deer Valley (most firm snow, some dust on crust)  
I’m a huge fan of Rustlers, and I like the direction of this new, more stable, more confident ski. Still totally fun in trees and deep stashes. I skied with a friend who rode an Atomic Vantage 97 Ti - a much more firm snow oriented ski - and I had no trouble keeping up once we opened up onto groomers. I loved this ski. I took it out again for a sunny day at Deer Valley and I continue to be impressed with its firm and soft snow handling. I struggled a bit in the rutted and firm bumps off piste, which were crust underneath a 3"" dash of dust. I'm glad I got that exposure but I still love this ski and would consider it an excellent quiver of one choice. The 188 is probably my ski, but I felt pretty stable in the 180 as well. If I’m being really honest, I would love it in a 185 cm length. 

Fischer Ranger 102 FR  
Length: 177 and 184 cm  
Test Location: Snowbasin Demo Days  
The 102 is a fun ski that almost anybody can hop on and enjoy. I found its floatation and playfulness to be excellent. It was delightful on a wonderful steep pitch of mostly untracked pow. I cruised onto some mellow packed powder groomers and found it incredibly easy to get on edge and carve nice arcs. The ski produces a remarkably round carve shape which was novel and fun, if not overpowering. The ski got a little lost in some tracked off-piste lower down the mountain, which makes me worry about how it would hold up in heavier Sierra snow. Given its ease of use, I would enthusiastically recommend it to a skier who wants a well rounded all mountain ski that doesn't punish them. To contrast it with the Ranger 99 Ti, this ski was more fun and approachable, and I felt it did great in powder. 

Head Kore 105  
Length: 180 cm  
Test Location: Snowbasin Demo Days  
The Kore series has done well for Head, and has helped a lot of skiers get into a freeride oriented ski that allows them to shred without draining their fitness. I like the 105 a lot, and I think the ultralight construction makes a ton of sense for a ski that ought to be more soft snow oriented. Yes, it still rails on groomers. Yes, it is disturbingly stable at speed for its weight. And it's rather dreamy in powder. My only complaint against this ski is that I wish it had more heft to charge through crud and even tracked pow. Many skiers will naturally gravitate toward is lightweight and highlight this aspect as a strength, so I file this critique as a minor one. I do give Head props for adapting each Kore mold to the demands of that model, and the 105 feels like a virtuous fulfillment of this category's most sought after features. I would vote for an Enforcer 104 free or a QST 106 as close competition for this ski. And the Ranger 107ti for the more expert, charge-y skier. One slight ding on this ski: the lack of a mounting plate seems to produce higher than normal binding failures. I’m not sure if Head has addressed this, but other ultra lightweight skis (old DPS) have needed to similar tweaks. Consider a helicoil. 

Fischer Ranger 107 Ti  
Length: 182 cm  
Test Location: Snowbasin Demo Days  
When I learned about the updates to the Ranger Ti series, I was immediately stoked and excited to ski them. Long a fan of the Ranger series, my only complaint on recent experiences was that I wanted more power out of the ski. Be careful what you wish for. The Ti is a beastly ski. I love its powerful carving. I love how stable it is in crud. And when I got the ski in untracked Utah pow, it floated like a butterfly, only to shred groomers just a few turns later with that deliciously precise Fischer continuous carve. All that said, this is a demanding ski, best for athletic skiers. I would struggle in tight bumps or rutted tree lines. I still love the ski...but maybe it could ease up a bit? Sincerely, Goldilocks

Fischer Ranger 99 Ti  
Length: 181 and 188  
Test Location: Snowbasin Demo Days, Alpine Meadows spring powder day  
I expounded on the Ranger Ti series in the 107 Ti review. The 99 is perhaps the ski that took it too far, at least for me on the 188 length. It's a fantastic carving tool. It has no discernible speed limit. It punished me in the bumps. It’s labor-intensive off piste. It's a beastly ski for sure, and those really strong demanding high speed skiers are going to love it. I think it still skis circles around the Mantra M5 in basically every category. But I will be thoughtful about which customers get to look at the 99. On a later trip, I grabbed a 181 and felt much more at home on that length ski. I still found the ski to be a little planky for my 170 lbs while skiing through some end-of-day pow at Alpine Meadows. It was phenomenal on groomers, and thus I find it to be an interesting ski for a quiver-of-one skier. Realistically, many skiers spend most of their time on groomers, but don’t want to be left out in the cold if the powder comes. For an all-mountain skier who wants one ski that is high performance on piste but still fun in powder, the 99 Ti could work nicely, but only if that skier has fitness and technique in spades. 

Volkl Mantra 102  
Length: 184  
Test Location: Snowbasin Demo Days  
If you read my Enforcer 88 review, you might expect me to dismiss the Mantra 102 as another business-driven product line extension from the smash success of this year's Mantra M5. Credit where it's due: the Mantra 102 is not only new and different - it's better. While the M5 clearly excels as a high speed, long radius, directional charger, the 102 is in fact a much more versatile ski, while still maintaining its charger pedigree. The triple radius sidecut - while not an altogether new innovation - does make this ski feel more maneuverable in tight spots. It's accordingly more floaty and fun, and more smooth than my memory of the M5. I really liked this ski, but the competition (Enforcer 104, 102) are also really great skis. I think the Mantra 102 will find its niche as a more versatile and therefore broader appeal Mantra. 

Armada ARV106  
Length: 188  
Test Location: Alpine Meadows surprise spring powder day  
I tested this ski out of step with the rest of the all mountain wide testing I did, so it’s harder for me to do apples-to-apples. I’ll start by saying that I generally prefer metal in my skis, and the list of all-wood skis that I actually like is pretty short. Well, the ARV 106 is definitely on there, and may actually mark a turning point in my attitude toward a) wood core skis positioned for soft snow and b) more forward stance mount. I took the ski up to Alpine Meadows and cut some afternoon stash laps on Alpine Bowl Chair. We were hiking Upper Saddle to High Yellow Face and Our Father, and the ARV was super fun. I found it to be a good combination of floaty and nimble. It was still perfectly capable as I hit higher speeds on the runout. The competition in all mountain wide is definitely challenging, but I think the ARV 106 stands out for giving a little more feedback and connection with softer snow. Like many of the all-mountain wide skis, this ski was still plenty of fun on groomers, so despite its width and lack of metal, it certainly would hold up for most western skiers.

### All-Mountain Narrow (88-98 mm waist skis)

An interesting category of skis. Some folks are going to like these skis as a potential quiver of one, particularly if you don’t actively seek fresh tracks. I generally feel like too many skiers, especially young skiers, overlook frontside skis. It is their loss. These skis are quicker, rippier, and more exciting, and they can make boilerplate groomers feel like your own personal race track. It’s worth trying one of these if you haven’t been on a narrower ski in a while.

Atomic Vantage 97 Ti  
length: 180 cm  
Test Location: Heavy sierra powder day at Mammoth Mountain  
The snow was turning increasingly wet by the time I took out the Vantage Ti. Not the right conditions for this ski, but I needed to try it out so I could differentiate from the Mantra M5. I liked it. Seems to be more versatile than the M5. Still charges. It’s an interesting build: at 97mm waist, I’m kind of scratching my head. Is this really a powder ski? If not, why would you want a ski this wide? I suppose that the extra width comes in handy when plowing throw crud, chop, and rutted snow, but that firm and flat tail is a lot to handle in off piste conditions. My personal feeling is that once you cross the 90mm line, at least some tail early rise is pretty essential. That being said, one of my favorite skis is the Stockli Stormrider 95, which has a firm if not punishing tail, and to this ski’s credit, it compares favorably to the Stockli and costs much less. I think that the Vantage style makes way more sense in the 86 and 90 models. Long way of saying: if you are a quiver-of-one skier who specifically doesn’t seek out off piste powder but still wants to ski on piste in variable conditions, this could be a great one for you. 

Stockli Stormrider 88  
Length: 177  
Test Location: Snowbasin Demo Days  
I owned a previous generation of the 88 and I loved it. I always found myself slightly between sizes. The 177 was more accessible and quick. The 186 was a point down hill, count 5 seconds, and then turn sort of ski. And the tears streaming backward out of my eyes were 50% joy and 50% fear. The new 177 feels like it gives me both worlds, and even at 6'1"", I feel right at home on this ski. Unshakable confidence across all snow types. Crisp, clean turning. The 88 is the gateway drug to edgy and more aggressive narrow skis...but it's a perfectly satisfying end state as well. For my California customer, I don't think it quite works as a one ski quiver, unless one deliberately plans to avoid deeper days. It’s too narrow to be a powder ski. But my goodness, this ski is smoother than a Lindt truffle and sharper than a Victorinox chef's knife. I was testing a host of \~88 mm skis and I almost felt bad because I took this ski out as a baseline. It's hard for any other ski to measure up. I’ll stop short of calling it a one ski quiver, and in the case of this ski, I think that’s a great thing: it’s so powerful and confident on piste while still being manageable in tighter off piste runs. 

Volkl Kendo 88  
Length: 177 and 184  
Test Location: Snowbasin Demo Days  
I tested this ski in a 177 and 184, and I just couldn't find the sweet spot. It's powerful. It's edgy. It floats adequately and doesn't hook too badly. The 3D radius sidecut is novel and discernible, enabling different turn lengths. All that said, I found both models to shudder on hard pack. The 184 was a plank for me, and I was more than happy to trade it in for the 177. I would enjoy it in perfect corduroy, but I found the ski to be buzzy and stiff.

Blizzard Brahma 88  
Length: 180  
Test Location: Snowbasin Demo Days  
The Brahma was a surprise ski for me. I like metal skis a lot, but hand-flexing this ski, plus negative experiences with the Bonafide, led me to think I would not enjoy the Brahma. I was wrong. It was a wonderfully precise carver. It navigated day-old pow with ease and aplomb. It was very comfortable at speed. Given that flat tail, I think it is a compelling option for the charger who knows how to finish a turn but still wants to hit some off-piste runs...but not too many. It does demand an athletic user, and folks who don't know they want metal will more likely be at home on other, more forgiving skis. 

Salomon QST 92  
Length: 177  
Test Location: Snowbasin Demo Days  
I've enjoyed every 19/20 QST. They are all fun, accessible, smooth, and reasonably precise and stable. From my experience, they ski more similar than different, at least in the models from 92 to 106. The 92 was only available in a 177, and I would have grabbed the next size up if it were available. It ended up not mattering. I was able to draw long and short carves with surprising ease. I did not take this ski up to high speed, but it seemed perfectly stable given the test scenario. The great thing about the QSTs, and the 92 in particular, is how easy the are to ski. That said, even aggressive skiers seem to like them. I'm going long on Salomon for next year. I would still choose the next size up (184?) for me in this model, but the fact that I could enjoy the 177 means that Salomon has succeeded in creating an amazingly broad sweet spot for the QST line.

Nordica Enforcer 93  
Length: 185  
Test Location: Snowbasin Demo Days  
One of my old and dear friends. I still love this ski more than just about any other ski in the category. As great as the Kore 93 is, the Enforcer offers that much more stability and confidence, especially when the going gets weird. It's also a better carving tool. Sure, you need to have the fitness to bend this ski, but it will reward you with the ability to drive through chop. It really stood out to me as the best Enforcer, save maybe the new 104. Or possibly the 110, if one has the good fortune to ski that ski in the right conditions. But the 93 is a very tempting option for the Tahoe one ski quiver. We took a winding road from Snowbasin's gondola, and I ended up doing figure 8s behind a ski patroller on a much narrower ski...until I accelerated past him. Love this ski, and was glad I took the time to ski it again. 

Nordica Enforcer 88  
Length: 179  
Test Location: Snowbasin Demo Days  
Admittedly, I was skeptical about this ski. The 93 was already such a smooth and crisp carver, I anticipated that the 88 was less of a ski design innovation and more of a product line extension. I hate when I let my prejudice get the better of me, but I came away with a similar impression after skiing. I didn't find myself enjoying turns any more on this ski...in some ways, I missed the 93. Maybe the Enforcer 88 can steal some market from the Brahma. Maybe there are some folks with bum knees who won't go for the 93. But it just didn't thrill me as a new offering. Still thought it was a smooth, polished, and enjoyable ski. Just not a thrillingly new or different ski. The reps (and some reviewers) tout the comparatively stiff tail. I’m a good carver, but I didn’t really notice it as a benefit over the 93, which is my pick purely for versatility. All that being said, the fact that Enforcers have won so many magazine awards and sold so many units, my guess is that there are a bunch of folks who have been holding out for a narrower ski, and I bet they will jump on this one. 

Armada Invictus 89 Ti  
Length: 179  
Test Location: Snowbasin Demo Days  
Woo hoo! The Invictus had me hooting and hollering, even as I grabbed it at the tail end of two full days of ski testing. Really fast, smooth, confident ski. I felt like the whole mountain was my carving playground. My colleague loves his Invictus and so I had to give it a shot - think this would be a great ski for somebody who rips but still wants the freedom to play. It has the confidence at speed that you get from the Brahma 88 and Kendo 88, but it was so much more FUN on the mountain. For me, it was a shockingly close second to the Stormrider 88.

Elan Ripstick 96 Black - 184  
Length: 184  
Test Location: Snowbasin Demo Days  
A premium ski in a relatively attainable price. Elan’s whole Ripstick line uses asymmetrical sidecut that increases edge hold on inside edges while easing up on the outsides. Translation: more power where you need it, while enabling you to smear off a little speed when the going gets dicey. I skied the 96 after ripping around almost all day on \~90mm skis, and found it to be very responsive for a comparatively wider ski. I’m still partial to skis with metal, but for somebody who likes the lightness of carbon, I think the Black edition - which adds an extra layer of carbon and thus an extra “top gear” for high speed charging - is a really appealing ski. 

Armada ARV 96 Ti  
Length: 184  
Test Location: Deer Valley, Squaw Valley sleeper spring powder day  
Excellent ski. One of the first skis I loved riding in a more centered stance. Relaxed and confident, and spectacular carving and edge hold for a twin tip, somewhat new school shaped ski. In fact, those adjectives feel wrong for this model. I enjoyed a bonus day on this ski ripping around Squaw Valley with Mike LaRoche. I had mistakenly predicted more groomer action, but Mike showed me all the powder stashes, often times a foot or more of chalky but light pow. The 96 did shockingly well given even in the deeper snow, and was an animal on the prepared piste. I will probably add this to the quiver...once I find the funds. 

Armada Tracer 98  
Length: 180  
Test Location: Deer Valley  
Easy, smooth, a close cousin to the Salmon QST 99, but perhaps not quite as damp. Armada has trimmed some weight here, clearly shooting for the touring market. My favorite top sheet of the year. It’s worth noting that in addition to being a fairly light ski, Armada built the Tracer to have more mass concentrated under foot, which makes touring more efficient. 

Stockli Stormrider 95 - 177  
O Stormrider 95. How I love thee. Let me count the ways. You are the most stable and eerily quiet ski on snow. You take any turn shape with ease. You glide through chop like a maglev train. You'll take me as fast as I want to go and still let me scrub speed if I get into trouble. Your edges slice into snow of all types, from corduroy to graupel to death cookies to boilerplate. You charge through crud better than the likes of the Mantra or the Bonafide, but you still let me feel the texture of snow. I hate most expensive things, but you make me question all that. Call me. 

### On-Piste / Groomer Skis (&lt;88 mm waist or groomer specific construction)

Stockli Laser AX  
Length: 175  
Test Location: Deer Valley, Squaw Valley, Alpine Meadows  
This is one of my favorite skis in the world. It’s a firm snow ski, and is rather not much fun in tight, firm bumps and similar terrain. Having spent years on skis north of 100mm, stepping onto the Laser AX’s 78 felt like I had been given the keys to an Italian sports car after schlubbing around in SUVs. Lightning quick edge-to-edge. Disturbingly stable at any speed. Edge hold that bends space-time. All of that, while still being fun to ski, whereas most other race-inspired skis will absolutely punish you if you don’t manage them. I own this ski and I pretty much will beg you to get out and try one for yourself. It will change how you feel about skiing. 

Stöckli Laser AR  
Length: 177  
Test Location: Deer Valley  
A new Laser! Hooray! This is a great new offering. It's interesting how Stöckli skis always have a lot of common characteristics. They are smooth. They have superb edge hold. They beg you (and sometimes taunt you) to open up the throttle. So what does the AR bring that's new? Stöckli has apparently positioned it as the least firm snow specific Laser. Softer tail for sure. I found it be more user-friendly even than the AX, which I praise for its user-friendliness. The AR is more forgiving, which I was pleased to find when I bombed through a narrow gulley and urgently needed to scrub speed on the snowy edges while turning through the icy trough. It's not quite as crisp as the AX, nor is it the speed-hungry powerhouse that the Stormrider 88 is. But it is more than capable in those departments, and it won't make you pay the price for getting a little loose. I think this translates into a very appealing package for the advanced-but-not-quite expert skier. I would enthusiastically sell it to anybody who wants a consummate carving tool and has the pocketbook to buy it. 

Atomic Vantage 90 Ti  
Length: 177  
Test Location: Deer Valley  
Great ski. Fast, precise, and exciting. And a reasonably great price. This ski tempts you to higher speed. One of my favorite runs of the day, and when I turned around, my fiancé was hot on my tails riding the same ski. She later told me: “I could have passed you if I wanted to.” It was awesome seeing her rip up the mountain. The Vantage 90 Ti prefers firm snow obviously, and I deliberately left it out of the all-mountain narrow category in my review because of it’s shape. I liked it much better than the Kendo 88. 

Atomic Vantage 86 Ti  
Length: 181  
Test Location: Deer Valley  
A very close cousin to the 90 Ti. I marginally preferred the 90, but I could attribute that to deteriorating conditions (or legs). Clean, precise, quick. Very fun.",skiing,1574488028,tree_stash,True,2019-11-23,1
What are your favorite ski films? Do any of them stick out to you from your youth?,"Last March, I broke my hand on the slopes, and unfortunately I wasn't able to get surgery until this past month. So it looks my season will be starting late this year. 

In the mean time, I'd love to know some of the better ski movies out there, or even to just spark a discussion on which older movies left a mark on you. 

More recently, I really enjoyed *Swift, Silent, Deep* as well as *Pleasure* the most. Back when I was young, I absolutely loved Warren Miller's *Cold Fusion* and TGR's Tangerine Dream.

Marker Squire bindings good enough?,"Hey, to start off, I weigh about 210lb and I'm 6'4. I would consider myself an intermediate+ skiier, but I'm pretty much a terrain park noob, (I plan to get into the park alot more). Anyways, I recently  bought a pair of K2 Sight skiis in hopes of getting a good all mountain, twin tip ski. 
Now I'm looking for bindings.

I've read a bit about the Marker Squire, and to my understanding they are not the best quality (apparently mostly plastic) and they're marketed for lighter, less aggressive skiiers (DIN range is from 3-11). My concerns are that the quality might not hold up in the park, and with a lower end DIN range, I would need to upgrade to a better binding soon as I get better at skiing. Would something like the Marker Griffon be alot better or could I manage with the Squire... 

If anyone has any tips/recommendations towards bindings that would be great! Thanks.",skiing,1574527728,porchboi,True,2019-11-23,1

Four Month Long Ski Vacation," 

Hey! 

I’m thinking about taking a break from “regular” life and living for four months in or just outside a ski town in late 2020 till Feb 2021. My goal would be to relax, unwind and ski daily to increase my skill (Right now I am a beginner with but a few days of skiing under my belt).

I’d like some advice on:

1. Which ski town would be my best bet? I’d love your thoughts on Colorado (Keystone, Vail, Breckenridge, West Denver area), or anywhere in the US if you know of some good places.
2. Any advice on temp housing for a month (where to look, best way to get). I’ve looked into ski leases and have found some promising leads.
3. Best place to look for ski lessons, as I plan on investing in lessons heavily early on to make the four months more enjoyable and productive.
4. Any tips for skiing over an entire season.
5. LPTs on what to bring with me to the mountain each day (backpack, camel pack, food, ect).
6. Gear recommendations outside the normal of skis, poles, gloves, socks stuff.

Thank you!!",skiing,1574537062,TheSpiciest-MemeLord,True,2019-11-23,1

Starter Confusion/ Help,"First of all thank you all for your help. I hope you guys can help guiding/confirming me especially with sizes and what to look for. Both of us have **0 ski experience**, and we live in Houston so ski stores are few and far between.

I had on Super Heroes of Stoke last week while working from home, the girlfriend sat down next to me she leaned over to show me she booked a flight for us to go to Breck for a week in February. The more I look into it, our work schedule (14 days on 7 days off &amp; owning business), we decided this would be our new outdoor hobby. So for the past week I have scoured google, friends that ski, reddit, evo, and really anything that could help with sizing and tips. The biggest issue is I'm 6'3"" 300lb (ex football lineman type) with a 13 4E shoe, one of my old teammates that is my size who lives in Denver told me to look for some ski's like him sized 183/105. The more I research I question if that is too wide for a beginner. 

I booked a private day long instructor to introduce us to skiing, and understand googles/helmets need to be tried on. Below is the research I've done and what we are looking at getting; I did Evo's package builder for help. So if you could tell me I'm completely wrong, have any recommendations, or tips to help I would greatly appreciate it.

Best Banff resort for 2 days skiing,"
Recommendations needed:

We will be in Banff for a week in February 2020 for a family event.  My son and I have negotiated 2 days ski-ing.

My experience:  I've had multiple lessons, had 4 trips to the French Alps and can parallel ski on red runs.

My son's experience: He is 15 and has been on one ski-trip (with 5 1/2 days of lessons).  He has potential, and he has little fear.  He still does plough/pizza turns but did tackle one red-run in his first trip.  He is on the verge of being able to do parallel turns.

I'm personally not interested in double-black diamond runs - I unfortunatey do have a modicom of fear (I'll be 50 when we go) so somewhere with lots of blues and some black diamond runs that we can progress to would be ideal.

We'll be based Canmore - so would like to be within 1 hour's drive.

Frustration with Armada Invictus 95,"I wanted to share some dissatisfaction I have with the 2019 Armada Invictus skis as well as with Armada itself. Let me know if I'm out of line. Otherwise, maybe use caution with Armada.

For background, I grew up in Colorado as a fairly avid skier. In my 20's, I moved to the mid-Atlantic region where, due mostly to cost, I had to cut back on skiing. I had been skiing the same Icelantic skis for about six years until this spring when I decided to get some new skis. I was in Colorado for work and purchased a set up from a small shop close to where I grew up. I just said I wanted an affordable, all around fun ski for hanging out with friends both on the east coast and out west. The shop suggested Armada Invictus 95s and I went ahead and bought them (along with bindings and boots).

It was May and I was able to give it a go for a day at A Basin (I had great conditions and was able to use the skis on most of the terrain including the East Wall). After that one day, I noticed that there was fairly extensive damage to the top sheet (see the pic). About eight inches of the top sheet was scraped off.

As I was in from out of town, I didn't have a chance to bring the skis back to the shop before my flight so I emailed Armada. Armada told me that to start a warranty claim I needed to go through the shop. I then called the shop and mentioned the damage. I said I recognized that the damage is ski to ski contact but I'm surprised that this happened after one day of skiing. I have skied many many days in the past and never has this happened. Don't get me wrong, there are dents and nicks but I have never broken through to the core (not to mention an eight inch long strip). 

The shop's employees recognized that this was odd but that it was ski to ski contact so a warranty claim might be tough. Still, they said they'd pass this along to the shop owner who would reach out to their Armada rep to see what Armada had to say. Well, every two or three weeks for four months, I'd call the shop for an update and they'd say the owner was out and he was the one who had to deal with it. I finally gave up with the shop and emailed Armada directly. (Maybe I should name the shop but it's tiny and I'd feel bad for the employees (definitely not the owner) who were always nice).

Alright, now were four months in and I emailed Armada with the situation. Again, I recognize that it was ski to ski contact, but the damage just struck me as unusual. Armada stated that they would look into it and see if it could be covered under warranty. They asked for additional photos which I sent. I then heard nothing from them for a month. So I sent a follow up email. Nothing. Two weeks later I sent another email and within a few minutes I received this odd and kind of generic email:

""I'm Sorry but i submitted your case for inspection and they immediately was denied since we are talking about tear caused by Ski to ski contact.

This is specified in our warranty policy [https://www.armadaskis.com/en/us/warranty](https://www.armadaskis.com/en/us/warranty)

I'm sorry but there is nothing we can do on our end.""

Look, I understand that it was ski to ski contact but after six months, including not hearing from Armada for a month and a half, I'm very frustrated with this response and my experience. 

I am not an engineer nor do I study skis but I believe the top sheet on the Invictus skis is different than the other skis I've looked at and I can't help but think there is a design flaw in there. Anyway, I do recognize that people really like Armada but I figured I'd share my experience.",skiing,1573843282,aaa2345,True,2019-11-15,1

Should I have done my first day on blues and steep hills?,"I’m a snowboarder, got good at it and tried skiing.  Today was my first day and my friend took me to a mountain where the only open trails were blues.  He tried teaching me and I was able to get some okay turns in and get some speed (24mph).  But I just kept falling and go pissed and broke my pole.  I just feel like I should have started on easier trails.  I’ll go really fast then lose control and fall on the really steep trails.

3lb (1.5kg) boots ? Yes please,"So I recently picked up some atomic hawx ultra to replace my decade old salomon shogun boots. I've skied the shogun with an intuition race liner for approx 80 days and the toe piece was getting down a bit for almost being binding incompatible. 

I found the hawx ultra stock liner to be somewhat lacking in instep volume and the toe box a little tight/ short relative to the shell. 

A few minutes and a bag of rice later and I'm moulding my 80 day intuition  for the hawx shell. World of difference in the toebox, much more comfortable over instep (intuition fix race has no plastic over instep at all).

(one more post about) Becoming a ski instructor in Europe,"Hi! I am 26, male, currently working as a full time phd student in Pisa in Italy and have been wanting to become a ski instructor for a long time now. I enjoy teaching friends how to ski and I like working with kids (although I haven't taught any how to ski up to now but worked with kids on other positions). Although I started skiing when I was 6 I don't consider myself an expert since I have been on the slopes around 8-9 weeks in total. I can tackle (european) blacks but without being super confident. On reds I keep a solid technique throughout the run. Due to my job I cannot spend a full season somewhere and because of that I would like to initially take an instructor course which lasts no more than 2 weeks. My goal is to firstly see if the job is something that I actually enjoy and secondly try to teach in Austria,Switzerland,Germany or Italy on weekends or during holidays (thus combining it with my current job). I speak fluently Greek,English,German and am learning Italian.

1. Is it realistic to teach only on weekends? Are there such teaching positions?
2. Due to my limited time I was thinking of doing one (small) course of two weeks this year and if I like it a second one next year in order to gradually improve my skills and certification. In 3 years I would be able to eventually spend a full season somewhere. What do you think of this ""plan"". Do you know any course recommendations that my fit me?

(Behinner) How long should I keep snow plowing?,"TLDR: new to skiing, should I force myself to snow plow or can I skip this step if I feel comfortable with going to normal skid turns after only 4 runs off 100 meters?

I'm 28 years old and decided I wanted to learn skiing, have been snowboarding for 10 years or so with 3-10 trips to the slopes every year. I bought some okay beginners skies + season pass and today was my first try at skiing.

Only after 200 meters of snow plowing it became more and more natural to do skid turns, quick and long turns. Carving the ski I did not understand yet. Approximately 4 runs off 100 meters in the child slope I moved to a shorter blue slope (we also have green slopes here), here I skipped snow plowing as it's a bit slow (and not fun). Only did 2 runs, 2km downhill total as that was what I had had time for (were snowboarding before). Legs were not happy after this, a bit tired done it was my first day for the season, couple of hangs that are not beginner friendly here where shorter turns from snow pile to snow pile was necessary.

Am I skipping something essential here when dropping the initial stage of snow plowing? There seems to be many doing this for hours and days before getting the hang of it. Should I just force myself to do it for X amount of hours to get some basics in? Turning, stopping both ways seems natural at medium speed (20-30km/h), just a bit unstable with where the skies are compared to each other, wide and narrow in the turns, I guess this is something that gets better naturally when skiing more.",skiing,1574028049,sennepo,True,2019-11-17,1

Advice for an ex-snowboarder,"I got into climbing in the last couple of years, and through climbing I've made a lot of friends who are backcountry skiers. I decided this year to make the switch to skiing, sold my snowboard gear, and picked up some ski gear at the local ski swap.

I've never skied before. I did snowblade when I was a wee lad, but I think that's hardly going to translate to the 108 waist skis I just bought. After buying these (139-108-127), I started thinking these might be hell to learn on. (I'm going to learn at a resort, not in the backcountry.)

I don't want to buy another pair of skis that might be easier to learn on because I don't see myself spending many days on the resort once I'm more versed in backcountry, will hopefully have all the gear and avalanche/rescue training by next season.

Should I just rent some carving skis for my first couple times at the resort? Or should I just go all in, have a bad time, and learn on mine?

Best Midlayers for Resort Skiing,"What are your favorite ski midlayers? I usually use a combination of a Patagonia R1 or North Face TKA fleece and an insulated jacket. Insulation layer is usually either a nano puff vest, a down vest, or a down sweater jacket, depending on the temperature.

For first time skiers: ditch the poles for a day!,"If you are learning to ski for the first time, try skiing without your poles for a bit if you are struggling. The poles just may be the culprit!  I know some mountains don't give brand new skiers poles (such was the case for me), but many do teach you with them right away.

Anecdotally: after my SO took his first lesson (with poles) he was struggling, falling constantly down a green run. I noticed that as he was skiing he was using he poles to attempt to catch himself as he lost his balance probably out of instinct since we as humans are VERY hand-oriented. I took his poles halfway through the run, and  almost immediately he was improving since he could simply focus on controlling his feet. By the next day he could hold his poles while pizza-ing down the mountain. At such a beginner level the poles don't serve much use to my knowledge other than pushing you across flats.

I'm not an expert skier, but hopefully this advice may be helpful for someone else that is struggling as a brand new skier.",skiing,1573356328,LogicalOtter,True,2019-11-09,1
Good options for a wider park ski,"I’m looking for new park skis this year, previously was in Icelandic da nollies, really liked them but the rocker profile combined with the narrowish width(for how much rocker) made them feel a little squirrly, I always felt if it was over 100 in the waist it would have been an awesome ski.

Anyway, most my park days are days when I know I’m gonna keep it mostly on the front side, and are more like 70% park 30% all mountain screwing around. I generally like a little wider ski, don’t mind big rocker ski, and ski pretty centered/like a center mounted ski.

I like to pop off, butter, and screw around on everything, but also like to hit stuff fast, I’d consider myself a pretty strong skier, so don’t need a complete noodle, but also don’t want a charger. I like to be able to flex into the ski a bit, but be able to load it up and pop out, same goes for nose butters.

I’ve had a couple park skis around 100 waist, I feel like my sweet spot might be 103-105, but obviously can go a little outside of that for the right ski.
I’m open to anything, but mostly been looking at the Jeffrey 108, maybe the Magnus 102, I’m leaning towards the Jeffrey cause if I’m going with a more burly ski, with that kind of rocker, a little extra width would suit it well.

The marksman, might be a smidge soft, but I don’t mind, seems super playful, but maybe a little awkward for park oriented skiing?

Fat-ypus m5, owned the l toros and friggin loved them, but a smidge wider and a little more rocker would be more my style

Looking for a ski bag that can handle 3 pairs of alpine skis for traveling on a plane. For reference I am transporting a pair of 2014 Line Prophet 179cm, 2015 High Society FreeRide 186cm, and 2015 Icelantic Oracle 155cm.

Only two things I've found are:
1. [Rossingol Hero 2/3 Pair Bag](https://www.rossignol.com/us/rossignol-ski-bag-2-3p-adjustable-190-200-ski-bags-tech-equipment-rkhb105-0000tu-2018-2019.html)
2. [Leki 3 Pair Bag](https://www.snowinn.com/ski-store/leki-alpino-ski-bag-for-3-pairs-alpine-skis/1094035/p)

My concern with both of these bags are that they are sorta canvas-like and do not have any padding in them. Should I be concerned about the lack of padding? I have looked at the Thule Roundtrip Double, Dakine Fall Line Double, and J Skis Double. All have the padding but are only doubles. I saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/skiing/comments/6tebkp/in_need_of_a_bag_for_3_pairs_of_skis/)  but wasn't that helpful as the links were either for the Rossingol bag, were dead, or not in English.

I have a hard-stop budget of $150 and would love to keep it under $100. 

Please recommend me a travel ski bag! Thanks for everyone's help in advance.",skiing,1573365605,cmonnats,True,2019-11-10,1

Tirol resorts from Innsbruck,"I'm headed to Innsbruck for Christmas with my partner this year.  We will be staying in Innsbruck but plan to check out 2 resorts on consecutive days while we are there.  I'm an advanced boarder, shes an intermediate skier.  Does anyone have any recommendations of great resorts around Innsbruck with the following criteria? 

\- short day trip from Innsbruck without a car.  Ideally short bus or train rides.  Renting a car is an option, but we'd like to avoid it if possible.

\- high likelihood of good snow in late Dec.

\- Good combination of intermediate to expert runs.

\- apres scene, beauty of landscape, and low crowd volume are pluses.  

The two I'm most considering are Stubai and Kuhtai, but I know these would be a little bit of a haul on the busses from Innsbruck.

My brother was able to get a deal on 2020 salamon QST106’s. After he got them and I looked they seem so wide and even the label says they are meant for more backcountry and the level of expertise is more on the advanced end.

I haven't been skiing in them yet but note the following:

* Hand feel is similar to a Bergans jacket I have made from Dermizax NX , but a little... softer? Not a crinkly material like most Gore shells, rather more stretchy and pliable - probably 70% shell and 30% softshell.
* The A-Cad really isn't lightweight. I realise these particular pieces are designed for resort / slackcountry riders but I do not notice any perceivable difference to comparable products.
* Build quality, finishing and features are fantastic, as expected from North Face / price category. Only thing I'd change is adding a zipper to make the powder skirt removable. I have never really found them useful, especially when wearing with a bib.

The A-Cad jacket has a lovely soft lining, which you could almost wear directly on skin. This is probably where the additional weight comes from when compared to the Brig / some of the pieces from the Summit series.

Advice for IKON based Jan Ski Trip,"I know this question is asked a lot, but everyone's circumstances are different so I figured I would ask for help anyway.  


Three of us are going on a ski trip, flying into Denver and flying out of SLC Utah 8 days later. We have the IKON pass so not worried about lift tickets. Here's our plan, tell me if it sounds terrible.  


Sleeping arrangements: Primarily in a van/SUV we rent with sleeping bags and hand-warmers.

Day 1: Land in Denver at 10 PM. Drive to Aspen and sleep.  
Day 2: Ski Snowmass or Highlands  
Day 3: Ski Snowmass or Highlands, drive to A Basin at night  
Day 4: Ski A Basin  
Day 5: Since it is a blackout Day and Winterpark is blackout free, ski WP  
Day 6: Also a blackout day, ski Copper since Copper is blackout free. Leave early and drive to Solitude SLC  
Day 7: Ski Solitude  
Day 8: Ski Snowbird  
Day 9: Leave

We've taken roadtrips before so we are used to a lot of driving, but we've never been out there in the winter so I'm not sure if my plan is naive. Also, sleeping in the van is going to really suck but unless we find Airbnbs for $20 per person or under, the trip will be too expensive otherwise (Factoring in food, gas).

Born in the winter of 1979, I'm now nearly 40 years old.  I was lucky enough to grow up on a crappy little midwestern mole-hill.  Dad got me skiing at about age 5 and it was the only thing I loved until about age 19.  I spent my teenage years making snow at night ($7/hour), selling concessions during the day ($5/hour but free food), and offering lessons (without the hill's permission) for $5/hr.  I was the best skier on my hill, but but never great by today's standards.  I loved it.  Every freezing, wet, icy, second of it.  

Then I moved to college in an even flatter section of the midwest, met the girl, married her, got the job, had the kids, and now its time to get back to skiing.

Teach me.  When I ""retired"" I was on skinny 185 Hart mogul skis.  Shaped skis, wides, park, backcountry?  Its all new and you're all obviously killing it.  What do I need to know and where do I start over?

Today I live in the upper midwest.  I'm a big guy.  I weigh 200lbs (slightly overweight but still fit enough to make a respectable effort) and I'm 6'0"" tall.  My beard is better than yours and I think your music sucks.

Help with Ikon pass and conversion van ski road trip,"I was hoping for some advice from locals and experienced skiers about CO and UT hills and road trip routes.

I have 6 weeks off from work starting Nov 30 - Jan 13.  I live in Toronto, Canada in a \[high roof Sprinter van\]([https://imgur.com/a/JRppzhe](https://imgur.com/a/JRppzhe)) which is insulated and equipped with diesel heater for 4 season living (as well as queen bed, sink, fridge, stove etc.).

My plan is to road trip directly to Denver where I'll pick up a few items I've ordered to general delivery at the post office there, then head into the Rockies to ski.

I'm an intermediate level skier but haven't skied much in the last 10 years.  I've never skied in the Rockies. Only much smaller hills like Tremblant.  My motivation for this trip is to find real mountain terrain that is impossible to find in the North East.  I really love glades and just exploring off-piste but I'm  not that experienced with that kind of stuff.  Groomed resort runs are not that exciting to me but I do love the idea of very long uninterrupted runs.  In Ontario the runs are so short it is ridiculous.  I'm also keen on incredible mountain scenery and chasing powder.

**My first major question is, should I get an Icon pass?**  I'm considering the Icon Base pass since the only blackout date that will affect my trip is the Christmas blackout.  It seems that given average lift pass prices, it should pay for itself with 10 or less days on the hill.  Also, Blue Mountain (unlimited) is part of the Icon Base pass which is 1.5 hrs from my home in Toronto.

**Second question, is there anywhere in CO or UT, given the type of skiing I'm looking for, that I should not miss but that is not part of the Icon Base pass?**  I know I really want to visit Arapahoe Basin, Steamboat, maybe Aspen.  The Ikon  Base pass includes lots of great resorts but are these mostly family skiing with groomed runs?  I'm just trying to make sure that the Ikon Base pass gives me access to some spots that have some good glades, off-piste, and aren't ridiculously busy.  I'll be able to go on weekdays so that should help.

Best Ikon Resort for beginner and intermediate/adv skier,"So my wife is about to start her second year of skiing  - after falling hard for sport last year in the west (we are based in east coast) we bought Ikon passes + local Pocono mountain season passes with skis for her. 

Looking to plan a few trips this year for her and I. While we will hit up Tremblant, Killington, and Stratton for east coast trips, I’d like to take a trip west to find a great powder spot (her first intro to skiing was heavenly). What I am struggling with is what resort gives her the widest option for skiing. She is a green skier but I believe approaching blue capability in many resort, like tremblant for example however not heavenly which had some of the toughest blue’s I’ve seen comparative to Vail/beaver or the east of course.

I’m primarily leaning towards Big Sky for the trip in February but I’m also looking at copper as a close second or 3rd a Banf. Looking at the trail maps though Big sky seems to offer her a ton of options green wise, hopefully some blue, backed by the private lesson I want to get her on the trip, and also some fund blacks for me. Since I try and stick with her for most of the day some varied terrain green wise, and some blue options she could ease into are my primary goal.

3 month ski trip in South America?,"Hi all,

1. Is living out of a non-4wd van doable? Worthwhile?

2. Compared to the US (we were planning to budget $100/day/person, not including season pass, and not living out of a van but hostelling) is it cheaper? I would think food is cheaper, but maybe lift tickets would add up to more than a season pass

I'm in the middle of hot waxing my bases.  I've noticed that there are a couple of small lines, which appear to be where wood has been removed, probably during the initial base clean (brass brush).  I was on my 4th cycle with wax before I noticed.

Should I strip back and start again, filling them with p-tex, or just continue to wax?  Theres about 5 of them in various spots over the base, all roughly the same length.

I'm kinda thinking that if I go back to the start, I might end up with the same problem again anyway...

Learning to backflip - advice please,"Hey there!

Bit of an odd one. I 'learnt' to backflip a few years ago on snow. Landed most, the few I crashed were close, and always on soft snow with a nice steep kicker. Since then, I've done one or two on an airbag every year.

BUT.

I can't do them on trampolines. This sounds stupid, but I'm not even close - like, land on my head or neck every time. This makes me pretty apprehensive about going for them on snow again (or trying one in the park, rather than backcountry) - I basically don't really know how to pick my landing, and it's kinda huck-and-pray.

I'm certain the backcountrydotcom leadership knew exactly what their lawyers were doing, if not actually directing the to do so; the backcountrydotcom CEO's apology letter wasn't an apology but a ""we're sorry we got caught"" letter; and I feel no on should be buying from them until they make things right with every business they needlessly attacked and damaged. Please keep us posted and let us know if and when you hear from them. I won't be buying anything from them until they make things right - there are so many other good outdoor businesses out there to buy from that don't suffer from the greed and bullying that have plagued backcountrydotcom since they were purchased by the private equity firm.",skiing,1573706516,wildswalker,True,2019-11-13,1
Advice on all-mountain ski (Salomon QST 99 / Nordica Enforcer 100 and others),"Hi all,  
I'm a good skier with a good experience on piste and a little experience in park. I'd like to buy a new pair of skis that I will use all days, on piste and off piste (not in a very deep powder), 40% piste /60% off piste  
My choice is between:  
\- Salomon QST 99 18/19  
\- Nordica Enforcer 100 18/19  
\- Salomon QST 99 19/20  


And (maybe?) Salomon QST 106 18/19.  


Have you any opinions on these skis? Others that I should consider?  
QST 99 18/19 vs QST 99 19/20, there are a lot of differences?

Max DIN too low?,"I am looking at picking up the following ski package from evo.  I'm a newly intermediate skier (mostly type ii but could stray into type iii at times) on the east coast hoping to get an all mountain ski for both on and off piste.  6', 210lb, BSL of 325ish.  I found what I believe is a ski that will work for my needs at a good price (Atomic Vantage 86 C) and am a bit concerned by the max din setting of 11.  According to a DIN calculator I'm in the 7-8.5 range.  I'm not super familiar with din settings and am curious if this is a range that I will need to go beyond as I progress and if the max of 11 is going to restrict my improvement.  Would this binding setup be appropriate for me in 181cm length or should i look for a DIN max of 12-14?  I've done some reading on here and it's hard to decipher what is good advice with everyone saying they have DIN settings of 12+.

Violent/gorey ski commercial,"This one is kinda uphill:
About 20 years ago, my friend’s dad was very technological and liked to pirate movies and burn them to DVDs. Not that it probably matters but the specific movie in mention was probably Kill Bill or The Big Lebowski and there was advertisement for skis prior to the movie start. I’m not sure if the ad was in English or not (his family lived in Europe for some time before they were our neighbors) and I can’t tell you what brand the skis are. However I distinctively remember the basis of the ad:
The skis had an edge where one could slice n dice a mob of goons. Limbs were dismembered and awesome jets of bloods protruded in all directions with a solid contrast to the white mountainside. In the final shot of the skis they are covered in gore with a bloody backdrop.

"[LONG POST] I want to pursue my dream of being a ski instructor, but I have a few questions.","TL:DR I don't want to pursue my current university degree and want to become a ski instructor but have several questions. (scroll past the wall of text if you don't want to read it and just want to see the questions).

A little back story on myself. I used to live in Parma, Italy which is fairly close to the Alps, so every winter I was fortunate enough to hit the slopes for at least one week since I was 8ish (can't remember exactly). I used to spend quite some time in the mountains during summer, hiking, rafting etc. Due to my history with the mountains I fell in love with them and had always pictured myself living somewhere in the Alps or at the very least, retiring there. 

Fast forward to the end of high school and first couple years of uni and I had let go of that dream, school pushed me to pursue university and a career in science. I personally made the choice to do a scientific degree but once high school rolls around kids are pushed to enter college/university and hardly anyone ever thinks about other career paths such as entering the police force, fire fighting, carpentering, plumbing etc. jobs that don't necessarily require you to do a university degree. 

So fresh out of high school I was at a bit of a loss, I was convinced I wanted to get into science so I halfheartedly started studying chemistry. I ended up dropping out as I absolutely hated it. This got me thinking about whether I actually wanted to go to uni at all, or maybe I just didn't want to be a scientist. So I started exploring my hobbies as possible alternatives but I was still stuck in the thought of absolutely having to go to university. So I thought about pursuing animation, since I love to draw and paint both digitally and traditionally. But I was quickly steered back on the path of science and I am currently in my second year of a Biomedical Science degree in the UK.

In the last few weeks though I've been thinking a lot about how unhappy I feel studying at university. I absolutely love the social side of it and have met some amazing people and joined some great societies, but the academic side feels like the least rewarding thing I have ever done. It's not due to lack of effort, I do well enough in classes to not just marginally pass. I just don't feel like this is what I should be doing and the thought of being stuck in a lab for the next several decades doing research in whatever field I end up in makes my skin crawl. 

Because of this, I've been thinking about what truly makes me happy and that is being in the mountains, skiing and not being stuck indoors. I've been looking at all the different qualifications that exist, estimated salaries, living costs etc. but there is quite a lot of information out there and I have some questions and would greatly appreciate it if anyone could answer them:

\- Is there any particular qualification (BASI, CSIA, etc.) that is better than others? in terms of employability within europe as that is where I would like to work so I can stay somewhat close to friends and family.

\- How easy is it to find a job once you have completed your qualifications? does this depend on the level of qualification you have?

\- If I do my course (as an example) in canada, and find a job somewhere in switzerland, how well will I be expected to know the area? will this be something I need to teach myself or will I take classes on the local topography?

\- How much does a newby ski instructor tend to earn? Will this salary need to be supplemented with a secondary job if I wish to permanently live within the resort?

\- What do you do during the off-season times?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope you can give me some answers.

Sincerely,

A lost human being.",skiing,1573755962,TheGhostlySheep,True,2019-11-14,1

Yakima SkyBox - Shaving down latch mech,"I have a Yakima SkyBox Lo, and it's paired with the low profile Rail Bar System. Mounted on an Audi A4 Avant.

Mammut R.A.S. 3.0 Questions,"I’m currently looking into getting in the backcountry a lot more and was wondering if someone had the answers to a few questions I have before purchasing. Im mainly going to be doing off piste skiing and lift/hike access areas. I got my first touring set up but don’t plan to go much further than what lift/hike access allows. Basically only planning on doing day touring trips up and around the resorts in my area.  
I already have the trifecta of a beacon, shovel, and probe. As well as being signed up for a few Avalanche safety courses intro and level 1. But I would like to be certain I’m doing the most I can to protect my life and know about the investment of these airbag safety systems. 

Does the Mammut R.A.S. 3.0 have a “onetime” use before it needs to be replaced? I understand that you need to fill your separate co2 canister in the first place. But once deployed one time is the bag no longer useable? 
If reusable after a single deploy, how many times?
The smart answer is to not even put yourself in those situations. But it’s hard to justify spending that much money on something that you couldn’t get a few uses out of in extreme situations. 
Does anyone have suggestions over this vs. other airbag systems or avalung systems? (More so looking for personal accounts that have used these different systems)
If so does anyone have any neat trick or tips about the Mammut system?
Once you connect the air canister to the Mammut 3.0 can you remove it at a later time if you’re just doing inbound skiing and don’t require a airbag?

Looking to buy my first pair of skis/boots,"Winter is coming and at 21 years of age I’m ready to buy my first pair of skis/boots.

I’ve been skiing since I could walk, probably between 5-10 days per year I’m on the slopes in the winter. So even though I’ve been skiing for years, I haven’t gone enough to the point where I’d consider myself an expert lol. I can ski down black diamonds and stuff but i really want to get into freestyle skiing.

The last few years I’ve gone to multiple terrain parks (can’t do any tricks) but love trying. I need skis that are good for terrain parks. Something that is smooth on rails, doesn’t hurt my feet when I land on a decent sized jump, and I want to be able to ski backwards. 

Price range is anything $500 and under. Not sure if I should get beginner or intermediate skis.

As for boots I don’t know much about what makes a good pair of boots but something comfortable, keeps my feet warm, and preferably doesn’t cause blisters on my feet/ankles. Price range $300 and under.

5. You like curves? Check that sidecut.
6. Race skis will help you better yourself (especially getting rid of your habit of leading your uphill ski)
7. Race skis don’t care if you’re ugly, as long as you point em’ downhill

Thanksgiving Skiing in CO,"I would like advice from some locals. I hope this is not the wrong sub for this.

I will be flying into Denver on the 11/28 and leaving on 12/2 for a skiing/snowboarding trip. I have the IKON pass and I am trying to decide if I should go to Aspen or A-Basin. A-Basin is higher elevation and conditions will likely be better?! I would try to stay as close to the lifts as possible, but that seems to be tricky given the lack of resorts and lodges near it. I also understand that A-Basin will be much busier during thanksgiving with people from Denver coming in during the day?!

Aspen is obviously a much more convenient place to stay at but the snow forecast makes me wonder if I should go there. Temperatures will be fairly warm this week, no new snow coming in any time soon and they have only had 6 inches thus far. I am not sure if they will even be able to open on time? 

Any advice if I should gamble on staying in Aspen or rather go for A-Basin. What are the chances that conditions will be materially different between the two?

Fast forward I went to my lokal shop and bought the Head Monster 83 because I read the Monsters are good for slope and powder. So when I got home I googled my ski and realized it is more a ski for slopes.

Now I don´t know if this is good or bad. On one side I wanted to do freeriding, on the other I like all the other facts of the Monster and will maybe be able to still get a bit of a taste of powder. So I thought I will try freeriding this season but manly stay on slopes and maybe if I like it buy a freeride ski for the next season.

I grew up skiing until I was in my early twenties, and haven't been in 8-9 years.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, when wearing them after a few moments, I'm feeling a ""pain"", or a numbness, its' hard to describe, in my foot. Is this something that goes away with time? I felt this on every pair of boots I tried on in the store. It is not a particular point of pain, nor is it consistent. After being on about 15 min in the store, I felt it in the left foot, and my right foot felt great. After wearing them for a little bit today, left foot felt great, right foot now felt this pain. I would liken this pain/numbness to the kind felt from doing too many squats on a bosu ball, where your foot is twisting in these weird balancing angles.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this normal that goes away after getting used to it? Or am I perhaps feeling muscles being used that I haven't used in a while?

How much should skis + bindings + mounting cost?,"Last winter, I made [a trip up to Whistler](https://www.reddit.com/r/Whistler/comments/a73sve/any_recommendations_for_ski_rentals_where_i_can/) where I rented skis and tried out a new pair every day. Through varying conditions, the skis that I loved the most were the [Rossignol Experience 84 Ai](https://www.rossignol.com/us/rossignol-experience-84-ai-skis-alpine-rahfi02-000-2018-2019.html). They handled really well on the ice, hardpack, and pretty well in powder. Being an east coast skiier, the first two were most important to me. 

I kept my eye out for sales over the summer, but I didn't see much for these guys. As someone who always tries to hunt down the best deal for something before I buy, I was getting the impression that seeking out specific skis might not fit that habit...

I happened by my local ski shop this past weekend where they did have some sets of the 84 Ai, however they all already have manufacturer-mounted bindings going for $700.

Requirements to apply:

* Minimum age is 16 years old.
* Avalanche safety/rescue certification.
* Must be relatively comfortable on black runs in ski resorts.

More requirements will be mentioned down the line, but for the moment so long that these three requirements are met before March, feel free to apply.

In other words, if you don't think you can bond with people easily, tend to have a hostile personality, or most importantly: Don't see yourself being able to act and respond appropriately in case the worse happens (e.g. avalanche), then please rethink whether or not this will be right for you.

To even say we screened at IF3 - I mean, that is just nuts, though we do believe the stoke is the same, our skiing is not.  We were stoked that Stan Rey, Alexi Godbout and Katie Burrell stayed to see our edit which was very cool. That in itself was just amazing. Stan even took our photo while there - so down to Earth despite being such an amazing and well known athlete and filmmaker. 

This whole thing is new to us and if you asked us 10 or even 5 years ago that would be screening at film festivals, we would have said, unlikely.

I had a coupon for sportchek that provided 70% off my entire purchase at the store.

When I went in I knew I wanted skis. I only ever had 25 year old skis which were about 190 inches. Super hard to ride and I could barely handle them. They only had 3 different skis in stock and the coupon was only valid for one day.

I purchased 2020 atomic vantage 97 C 171 for under 270 CAD with bindings.

I felt like I wanted a shorter ski so I could easily turn and enjoy good handling. 

I am 6’3 190 lbs.

Nordica Enforcer 104 vs. K2 Mindbender 108,"20s M living in Colorado, 6'2"" 180lb. I own a pair of rossignol s7's (115 underfoot) and bent chetler 100s. THe S7's are huge and Chetlers are slightly too noodly for me and not great in powder (and only 180cm...), so I'm looking for an ""in between"" ski that I can 1) drive pretty hard without sacrificing TOO much ability to slash around and pick through tight terrain at slower speed. All that keeping in mind that I'm in a west coast snow environment and thinking 100 underfoot minimum. I have a sense of how both the Enforcer and Mindbender perform at speed and in powder, but any advice on maneuverability and/or playfulness at variable (i.e. not super fast) speeds? I'm an aggressive skier, 90% front country, and I ski on the playful side of what'd you still call a traditional directional skier.",skiing,1572078969,whispertoke,True,2019-10-26,1

Hope I made the right choice,"Hey everyone 
My first post in this sub and I don't know where to start off. 

So I'm 20 years and began snowboarding when I was 10 years old. I had to go to a snowboard school (or whatever it's called in english) because no one in my family neither is able to ski nor to snowboard. So I have never learnt to ski at all. Thought maybe snowboarding is quite cool and so on. So because of this school I was able go snowboarding four times a year a full day. I did this for 4 or 5 years in a row. But I got tired of it because I never really progressed because of my lack of practice outside of this school. 

And here we are now and I really want so badly to learn to ski. Registered myself for a ski course next year. Because I know I probably want progress at snowboarding at all and rather start off with something new. And I see more advantages in skiing than snowboarding. 

So here are some questions I'm really curious about: 

1) Can I still learn skiing despite my age? Most people start with it as a kid. 

2) How hard is it to start and how fast can you progress? For example how long does it takes to manage a blue slope.  

3) My biggest fear is that I cross my skis and fall. Is it hard as a beginner to keep the skis apart?  

4) Could learning how to ski also help me with getting better at snowboarding? 

I know these are 2 diffrent kind of sports. 

5) And is there a chance that my (low) snowboard skills giving me an advantage when starting to ski?

I'm sorry for the really long text and probably also the language (not my mother tongue). But I'm really curious about all this things. 
Thanks everyone",skiing,1572081218,Lucernar,True,2019-10-26,1

Nordica Santa Ana 100 Sizing,"I purchased the Nordica Santa Ana 100s in size 161 at the end of the season last year as my first pair of skis after 8 years of renting.

Help finding downloadable data (e.g. .csv file) on snowfall and other relevant data for ski resorts?,"I hope this is allowed, I don't think I'm breaking any rules, so I figured I'd take a shot.

I'm doing a project for grad school based on data analysis. The goal of the project is to gather information about 4 resorts, 2 that are accessed via the Epic Local Pass and 2 by the Ikon Pass, and provide a recommendation on which pass to purchase. The data I'm looking for is stuff like: average snowfall per day, start date of ski season, end date of ski season, runs open by day, things along those lines. 

Anyway, if anyone knows of a good website or other resource for data like this, I'd really appreciate a point in the right direction. It doesn't necessarily have to be downloadable, but the less data I have to scrape from a website, the better lol. Also, the more boring and scientific the data is, the better. Just numbers, numbers, numbers. Like, imagine skiing, except at a desk, with no snow, a lot of raw data, and writing code on Python. 

And just to be clear, I have tried looking, but I can't find information that isn't presented in a way that appeals more to aesthetics than actual data. I figured this community might be aware of better, trusted resources for resort snowfall and other data.

"Built a ski jump in a public park, potential city fine","So me and my buddy where getting stoked for the upcoming ski season and decided to build a kicker in a public park out of dirt(Just so we wouldn't have to labour over snow pilling in the winter).

On Saturday where casually working on it when some city guy comes up and says he has to report my license plate to the city on Monday if we don't take down the jump(The guy was on his day off walking his dog but worked for city parks). 

He proceeds to tell me that I'm going to be liable for however much time it takes to take down the jump(probably 1 hour of city workers time).

Can they do that? It's public property and people build jumps in this park all the time(mind you out of snow not dirt).

What happens if I don't pay this fine? They have to prove that me and my friend built the jump somehow right?

Also there's multiple dirt bumps all over the park, his argument is that we would be liable for injuries but the dirt clump already existed there, we just built on to it.

"First time skiing - buy a helmet or rent, and how much to spend? (UK)","Hi Everyone,

I have had a few skiing lessons in an indoor snow centre, but now I am getting ready to have a week at Les Deux Alpes in January, for the sake of simplicity I have bought all my gear from Decathlon ([decathlon.co.uk](https://decathlon.co.uk)), I have already spent £300 to kit myself out and I am trying to be sensible with my budget but I always get carried away!

Originally I was going to rent a helmet but it will probably cost me £20-30 to rent one for a week, and for that price I could buy a basic one which I know the history of, so that was my original plan, buy something like this  [https://www.decathlon.co.uk/h300-adult-ski-helmet-white-id\_8374251.html](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/h300-adult-ski-helmet-white-id_8374251.html)  but then I think for £5 more I could get this one  [https://www.decathlon.co.uk/ad-m-d-ski-helmet-pst500-blk-id\_8543286.html](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/ad-m-d-ski-helmet-pst500-blk-id_8543286.html) or then for a bit more, one has a hard shell that covers the ears too (is that a good thing? I don't see many helmets that have that!), then there is another tier at £50, and then for £70 I can get a MIPS helmet and before I know it I have spent far too much money. Certainly I don't want to skimp on my safety, and hopefully, I will enjoy my trip in which case having a good helmet will last me a few trips, but realistically as a newbie do I need a MIPS helmet? I doubt I will be going fast and I can always invest in a better one for my second trip...

What do you guys advise? I have no idea what kind of helmet I can rent so it could be a basic one or it could be a high spec one or is it best to buy one and how much money to invest (what if I decide I never want to ski again?)!

Help? Regressed after an embarrassing skiing accident and am scared to ski now.,"I've been skiing a couple times a year since I was 12, I'm 20 now, and up until two years ago I would call myself a moderately advanced skier. I was pretty fearless and could handle double blacks, tree runs, and small jumps, but I have never been able to ski moguls. 

A couple seasons ago I went with some friends who were true experts, and made the mistake of believing I could keep up with them on a backside double black of moguls-- inevitably ate complete shit (lost my skis, tumbled, sprained ankle, slammed my head into my knee hard enough to hurt for a few days). I got back up and kept skiing, but since then, I've been a completely different skier. 

Now I am only really comfortable doing greens and blues. It feels so unnatural-- I am stiff and tense, can't gain speed, I'm scared to take sharp turns, and just have really lost all confidence. I think it might be I am still embarrassed about thinking I could keep up with people far better than me, but I miss the adrenaline I got from skiing-- now I am just scared.

GEAR QUESTION: Seeking lenses for really old Smith Goggles (Cariboo OTG/Monashee OTG),"So I've acquired a bunch of very old Smith Goggles, about 100 to be specific. These are identified to be Cariboo OTG/Monashee OTG Models when I contacted Smith. There's a good number of these that do not have lenses. I've looked all over online to see if I could get any replacement lenses for these specific units but apparently they have been discontinued and out of production for well over a decade so I can't find any of these lenses in the market. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering if there are any other goggle lenses this may be compatible with? The closest looking lens I could find is the Smith Knowledge OTG which the lens appears to have the same air vents and everything. Here is the link for the lenses: [https://www.amazon.com/Smith-Optics-Knowledge-Goggle-Replacement/dp/B005UHICWG](https://www.amazon.com/Smith-Optics-Knowledge-Goggle-Replacement/dp/B005UHICWG) and [https://www.amazon.com/Smith-Knowledge-OTG-Replacement-Lens/dp/B075QDQYC4](https://www.amazon.com/Smith-Knowledge-OTG-Replacement-Lens/dp/B075QDQYC4/ref=pd_sbs_468_t_2/138-4690343-0978610?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B075QDQYC4&amp;pd_rd_r=6ac91de7-f749-46fc-9c03-b3848eb2fe16&amp;pd_rd_w=MokeV&amp;pd_rd_wg=XobTE&amp;pf_rd_p=5cfcfe89-300f-47d2-b1ad-a4e27203a02a&amp;pf_rd_r=1DB45VTPNAR4ECNJ3XX9&amp;refRID=1DB45VTPNAR4ECNJ3XX9).

Hi - Ski Options first Week of February,"This is taking a lot of time and I've been lurking around various forums to figure out where I'd like to set up a ski trip for my friends and I.

We live in Florida but have so far been to Breckenridge out west and several places out east. We want to go west again this year and trying to pick between Colorado, Lake Tahoe or some places near Salt Lake City. I think I will use this post to focus on Colorado because Lake Tahoe seems to be the most expensive, and Utah doesn't have recreational pot.

Breckenridge was nice but we had gotten altitude sickness last time. IS the beginning of February good enough for Colorado resorts? What would be a comparable one to go to that also has night skiing? Are Vail and Aspen accessible via driving at that time of year from Denver or do you have to fly in? 

Trying to figure out what is best price wise too, I'll continue to do research. I'd rather be close enough to the mountain to either do ski-in ski-out or at least not spend more than 5-10min driving or worrying about parking. I've noticed this cut too much into ski time when we went last year staying in an awesome house but it took 20min to get to a spot.

People in my group had never skiied before even though you had to if you wanted to go on the trip.

They extremely under fed us. I went a day and a half without eating at one point. It was terrible. 

It basically made me have panic attacks. I cant stay away from home now as im so scared. I begged the teachers to let me go home but as it was so far away, they denied.

"Epic Local Pass - dream season incoming, need advice","Hey everyone, 
I’m lucky enough to be wrapping up college in the spring; I only need one more class or graduate, and the class I’m taking only meets one day a week, on Tuesday. I bought an Epic Local Pass with full intent to maximize my use of it; I’m lucky enough to have some cash saved up from working and interning previous summers that I’m absolutely ready to travel and do it big this semester. I’m looking for trip advice and scheduling as I look towards booking flights and making plans. 

For context, I’m a confident skier on ungroomed blues and groomed blacks, and am working on building up my confidence on ungroomed blacks, which I can ski but not nearly as well. I’ve been fortunate enough to spend a decent bit of time in Vail, and love Sundown/Sun Up Bowl, as well as Blue Sky Basin, if that gives you an idea of the kind of stuff I like to ski (open bowls and love that backcountry feel in blue sky). 

My current plan: 

Vail first week of January (booked)

Park City late January during Sundance with buddies

Vail again/CB in mid-February

Heavenly in early March around spring break time for skiing/gambling/general partying with friends

Whistler/Breck in April if snow permits

The goal would be for each of these trips to have at least four ski days baked in. Any thoughts, changes, or additions y’all would recommend? My only date restrictions are the ones provided by my pass (along with a trip to New Orleans for Mardi Gras), and I’m trying to keep the total cost of all of these trips combined under $10k (we have family in Vail which helps alleviate costs there).

One company to avoid is Warren Miller Entertainment. Please avoid this absolute snake of a film company that completely screwed over Warren Miller.

Any suggestions before ordering Enforcer 110s,"I’ve had my heart set on buying a pair of Nordica Enforcer 110s since moving to Denver last year. I’ll be honest and say that’s based off of talking to some people who were skiing them as well as many hours of reading online. I was given permission to order them by the wife but always have buyers remorse on everything I buy so I’ve been sitting idle for a little over a week now. The Mrs asked me earlier when the skis will arrive because she is expecting me to want to start skiing over the next month or so. I told her I was worried about making the wrong decision and hadn’t actually placed the order yet. She said I had better get on it for multiple reasons.

I’m realizing that I may be discounting some of the smaller ski companies gear. I definitely don’t want to rent again this year. I absolutely plan to purchase/order something this week. I would love to hear some of y’alls recommendations for a very similar ski to the Enforcer 110 please.

A majority of my skiing is on piste. My wife prefers to ski blues and the occasional black. I love skiing with her but when I’m hitting these I like to hit them fast, stopping for her to catch up. I don’t ride park ever although my 9 year old is starting to. I doubt I will spend much time if any in there and when I do I’m not looking for rails or anything. As most others, I love powder and am hoping to start doing a little more exploring on the epic resorts in Colorado. I had my head set on the Enforcers but what else should I consider. I only plan to have one set of ski’s for the next year or two most likely. Damn kids are too expensive nowadays.

Nothing to crazy, but enough to take some enjoyment away. I believe it’s because I have slight “duck feet” and skiing  inherently forces you to keep your legs straight. 

I’m already investing in knee braces for this season, but does anyone have any other tips on how to help inner knee pain while skiing? I’m in the market for new boots so maybe a specific brand / style? Or maybe a lighter ski perhaps? A change in form? Any tips would be very helpful!",skiing,1571673638,JamezG97,True,2019-10-21,1

seeking advice for a honeymoon ski trip to the Alps (Americans),"My fiance and I are avid skiiers/boarders and want to go to the Alps for our honeymoon. The only place we want to go for sure is Chamonix, but we will have 2 full weeks so I want to hit at least 3 resorts total since the rail/bus system is excellent over there. I'd totally be down to hit Italy, Switzerland (only for a few days due to $$), or Austria as well if it's accessible by train

Do you guys recommend hiring a travel agent? If so, do you have any to recommend that have experience with the Alps? I'm normally really good at planning trips myself, but the ski culture seems a little different over there (off piste with a guide, more package deals, yadda yadda) and it seems overwhelming. 

My questions are basically this: 
*which top resorts (in any surrounding country) are easy to get to/from Chamonix by public transit
*what order should we do them in to avoid European holiday crowds, etc. 
*what are the ""stereotypes""/short summaries of all of the big places in the Alps? 
*which places have the best apres?
*which places have easy access to other non-skiing activities for our days off?

I just feel like there are so many options I don't know where to start.

Putting Shift bindings on Fischer Hannibal 96s?,"I bought some undrilled 2018/2019 [Fischer Hannibal 96s](https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/reviews/snow-sports/backcountry-skis/fischer-hannibal) at a swap last weekend. I'm planning to ski 70/30 in/out.

I'm 5'9'', 155 lbs, and a serviceable but not particularly aggressive skier.

Is there a fatal flaw in this plan? I don't know much about gear, and I don't see many people putting Shifts on light medium-width skis, so I'm worried I'm missing something obvious.

I wanna git gud,"Hi everyone,

So I skied a bit when I was a kid probably yearly, when I was 10 to 16 or something. Took lessons but never progressed past moderate difficulty. Then suddenly started skiing again last year at 25 and it all came back and now I'm obsessed.

This year I'm ready. I've got the pass. I've got the trips planned. Living near a resort for two weeks soon, and more coming. I bought the gear.

But I know nothing about form. Honestly. I just go down the mountain. I can do a black diamond without falling but that doesn't say much, every slope is different.

I don't know any of the terms or anything, I didn't even know about leaning forward into your boots, or having your core facing the fall line or whatever that is, I don't know what pole planting is (I looked it up, still confused), I just do what feels right and get down the mountain and have a lot of fun.

This season I want to form it up. Where do I start? Lessons? Reading? Youtube tutorials? (please no youtube tutorials) What do I do to git gud?

Advice on the Mantra M5 vs other all-mountain skis,"For the last couple of weeks I've already been dreaming about the winter season coming up... 

I'm thinking about buying the Volkl Mantra M5 (96) (currently at €630), but still doubting as there are other good options. Looking for a second opinion and inputs/experiences of other skiers. 

I'm truly looking for a one-ski quiver, a ski that can do anything: high-speed carving on piste, some crud, bumps, some deep(ish) snow and the occasional jump or trick and skiing a bit of switch (not that important).

Other options I've seen include for example  
\- Salomon QST 93/99  
\- Head Kore 93/99  
\- Line Vision 98 (more playful, but still advertised as a very good all-mountain)  
\- Blizzard Bonafide

Ex Racer Ski Recommendations?,"Hey Gang,

So 5’ 10’’ ,  175lbs, I have been skiing for most of my life and like the title says I raced as a kid and stopped in high school.  I have been on race skis for most of that time and am looking to get onto something more versatile.  I ski about 40 days a year, mostly in the Midwest but I also spend some time in Winter Park.

Last year I bought a pair of Rossi Experience 84 Ais and love them, but I am looking for something a bit wider for variable snow and terrain.  I have basically narrowed my choice down to:

Nordica Enforcer 100 

K2 Mindbender 99

My thoughts are is that the K2 is newer and untested, while the Nordica is tried and true for a lot of people.  The K2 is supposed to be more maneuverable but the Nordica can basically be skied as hard as you want.  I like what I read and see in reviews about the K2s, but I give more credence to “real” people (this sub) actually skiing a ski.

Time for new sticks! Any thoughts?,"SLC local here ; )
29 y/o male weighing in at 165lbs &amp;  5’ 10” very athletic 
I am an aggressive skier with a playful style and spend most of my time in the trees. 

I run Icelantic Shamans and love the short turning radius and surfy feel in the powder, they are incredibly fun! But they are a little chunky and it wears on you for a full day of skiing. I will keep these for deep days.

I’d like a do everything ski that is 1500 or so grams per without bindings with twin tips and a short radius that is very fun.  (95-110 underfoot) The Icelantic Nomad Lites has been in the back of my mind. DPS Wailers have come up, as have the Armada ARV.

Any recommendations would be appreciated.

"Looking for recommendation for second pair of skins (expert, volkl mantra)","Hey everyone,

I am looking for a second pair of skis and was looking for some advise.

Skier type: ski anything type, spend 75/25 east coast/west coast. I love spending time in the trees on the east when conditions permit, typically bomb groomers if I have to be on them and out west usually am looking for steeps and untouched powder stashes.

Because I only get out west once or twice a year I have limited myself to a 1 ski quiver. Currently on a pair of newer (full rocker) Volkl Mantras.

Things I like about them: extremely stable at speed. If these things have a speed limit, I sure as hell haven't found it. Very confidence inspiring. Handles powder and variable conditions (softballs, tree roots, whatever) very well. Rips groomers, good hard charging ski, very slashable when things get tight, but requires a lot if energy.

What I dislike: they are a bear to go slow on (time with less skilled friends or GF) being that they are full rocker and wideish and don't engage the edge without learning into a turn. They have a very wide turning radius and suffer a bit in tight east coast mogels and trees. To overcome these shortcomings you need to exert a lot more energy than I'd like to a lot of the time. Sucks at jumping. Longer turning radius than I'd like on steeps (but as stable as I'd like for steeps).

What I want: something that is very stable, but capable of slowing down a bit, maybe getting some (small) air, better in tight trees and steeps. The mantras are good for hard charging days, but I want something with similar stability traits and occasional powder time, but that doesnt always need to go 60mph.",skiing,1571188134,anongtimk7,True,2019-10-15,1

I used to prefer grey/smoked because they don’t alter perceived colour but lately I’ve discovered how much different tints add to the “feel” of riding, especially when paired with music and the buzz of your choice.

Obviously performance in the prevailing light conditions is the most important thing when choosing a lens on a given day but if I have multiple lenses suitable for the conditions I’ll always choose one that is more satisfying to look through. For high light days I use a reflective blue lens that gives a yellow-tealish tint and on low light days I’m a fan of rose pink. Blue and green tints look pretty sick too.

Like everybody else I'm very much looking forward to the upcoming season.  So much so that I'm thinking of picking up a new set of skis, but I need your help!

Backcountry Touring,"Hello you beautiful bastards.

I took my skis in for their first tune of the season today and my stoke level is over 9000!

I am seriously considering getting into some Backcountry Touring but I am new to the Backcountry and I wanted to consult the hive mind.

I'd consider myself an expert in bounds skier. I grew up skiing far west Alpine racing in Big Bear where I learned on piste and then moved to Tahoe when I turned 13 and learned to ski Tahoe cement and occasionally killer pow. 

I've skied Cali, Utah, and the Alps.

I'm good in steeps, trees, chutes, nearly any terrain that can be found in bounds.

This January I'm headed to Japan and then Big 3, followed by some time in Big Bear, Tahoe, and Utah.

I have some friends who have gotten into touring and I think I'm ready to try it for myself.

This season I'm planning on doing my Avy1 course at a bare minimum but I'm most interested in your gear choices.

Tell me about your gear!!!

What kind of bindings do you use? Is it compatible with an Alpine boot or do you have special touring bindings and boots? (I've only ever used Alpine bindings and boots).

What kind of skins do you use?

What kind of skis are you riding? (I'm currently on the Rossi Sin7 which is 98mm underfoot which I skied on all last season in all conditions).

What are your absolute musts to have in your backpack?

Tell me about your Avy kits.

And finally if you can point me in the direction of any good books, websites, or other repositories of Backcountry info I'd appreciate it. I'd assume the vast majority of my back country touring will be in the Sierras as I live in southern California.

I was pretty set on a pair of Atomic Bent Chetler 100's, talked to a sales guy at the local ski shop, read and watched a bunch of reviews online about them, but after reading some posts on here, I'm 2nd guessing the BC's.

The following are on my short list:

Atomic Bent Chetler 100's

Atomic Vantage 97C

Head Kore 93

Blizzard Rustler 10

Beaver Creek First Week January,"Hey all,

I have a conference that I'm considering going to the first week of Jan (like 4th to 11th) in Beaver Creek (coming from east coast).

Touring Ski Length,"Hey all, wondering if I could get your advice on length for a touring ski.

I’m thinking of getting into touring on the east coast this year. Right now I am all resort and I alternate between Enforcers in 177 and J Ski Vacations in 180.

Found a pretty good deal on used Blizzard Zero G 95’s, but they are 185’s, which is longer than anything I’ve ever skied before. 

I’m 5’11” and 160 pounds. I know the answer to the question “is 185 too long for me” is definitively “no”, but I’m wondering, for tight east coast trees and narrow trails, would it make sense to size up from where I normally am, or to size down? I would have thought the latter, which would make me pass on the opportunity.

Any view? Is there any reason to size a ski differently for touring as opposed to resort skiing?",skiing,1570757524,gufmo,True,2019-10-10,1

Ski length - 145cm or 152cm?,"Hey everyone,

Just bought my first ski boots (yay) and also technically bought my skis. However I am second guessing the length I was sold... the shop I was at sold me a 145 Black Pearl 88, but all of the guides and calculators online put me at a 152cm or higher. 

I understand that shorter is better for beginners and for easier turning, but longer is better for progressing, speed and stability (which is what I want to work towards). 

I’m 160cm tall, about 110lbs and ski in the PNW. Should I be running back to the store to switch out my 145s for 152s?

Question on sitting around in boots,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/3968cz45uzr31.png

&amp;#x200B;

Casual skier in the past (couple times each year). Always rented. Generally did ok with rental boots (have come to find out they were likely low flex).

 Getting a pass, boots, and seasonal rental this year.

Did some research, spent a couple of hours at a boot fitting, ended up with two pairs of boots (will return one before going on the slopes).

I've been wearing both pairs while at home. A mix of standing and sitting (cooking dinner, tv, etc), and both are very uncomfortable. So far haven't managed to wear them for more than an hour or so without moderate discomfort and some numbness. Tried light and lose buckles, with and without a footbed.

Is there any benefit to this approach? E.g. wearing boots while at home to see how they feel, then pick the one I want to try and ski with? Or am I screwing things by wearing ski boots in a non-ski environment?

I'm worried that I'll buy a non-refundable season pass only to discover that I can't tolerate the dam boots for more than a couple of hours.",skiing,1570835248,grimzecho,True,2019-10-11,1

"Planning a ski trip with 8 yo son. Revelstoke, Schweitzer, other off-the-beaten-path recommendations?","Hey all, in addition to the title, here’s some other context:
-My son and I get about 20 days in each season for the past two years, most at Mt. Hood with a couple trips to Bachelor. 
-He likes to ski a lot. He prefers lunch on the chairlifts “so we don’t waste any time, Dad”, and on days with night skiing we usually go 9-6, until his siblings burn out and drag him off the mountain. 
-He’s a competent skier, most comfortable on greens and blues, though he can sloppily but comfortably go do Mt. Hood blacks (read: not a real-deal blacks). 
-he’s a confident skier, brave and willing to push himself and bite it, but not a caution-to-the-wind dare devil
-he knows how to ski in control, knows his limits, but likes to push them a bit
-he’s just learning to properly carve. Not there yet but I suspect by end of this upcoming season he’ll be there. 
-we spend more than half of most days in terrain parks, usually on kickers and box tops and sides in  flow parks, rather than boxes and rails. He just told me his goal thus test is to get good at switch so he can get 180s down. 
-we aren’t ready (or trained) for backcountry. 
-For me, I just love doing what he is up to, though lately I favor the parks. 
-we are planning a trip to get in 2-3 full days of skiing on this trip, and I want to find something that is new to us and off-the-beaten-path l: for the novelty, sense of adventure, and more reasonable costs for lifts and lodging. 
-I prefer to drive but will consider flying. 
-we had our hearts set on revelstoke. Though neither of us have been there, it has an allure that captured us. 
-a friend just said they were looking for the same criteria and tried Schweitzer and loved it. 

Having never been to either, any of you with experience at either place have suggestions or feedback? Or other drive-able places we should consider based on the above?

Regarding the final clear coating, I’ve seen people use either spray-on or epoxy. While epoxy would be the best, would spray-on clear coat work fine?

 When using stencils for text, my plan is to tape a layer of painters tape on the skis, glue my printed out stencil design over the tape, and then use an x-acto knife to cut away at the stencil.

Looking for advice for second pair of skis,"I'm looking for advice about getting a second pair of skis.

Background info:
- 36 y/o
- 187cm - 6'1""-ish tall
- 87 Kg - 190 pounds
- location: Austria
- advanced skier
- skiing about 80-90% on piste right now
- current gear: 2017 Volkl Kendo (90mm) in 177cm length + Atomic Warden 13

I love the Kendo. I think it's a fantastic ski for the conditions I ski in and it fits my more aggressive style very well. It's fast, stable and precise on piste. It works relatively ok in deeper snow. I think it's a bit heavy for that, and maybe the 184 length would have been better for that.

Why I'm looking for a second pair: the Kendo works great when I'm skiing alone. Skiing with my girlfriend or friends of other skill levels is different. The skis feel like they have a lower speed limit. I'm looking for something that works on these kinds of days, something that is a bit more playful at lower speeds.

What I think that this ski could be:
- something with less (or no) metal in it
- up 100-ish in the waist
- maybe a park/freestyle oriented all-mountain ski
- similar or lower weight than the current setup, I don't mind the weight that much. Currently it's about 2500g per foot including binding
- medium to long turn radius

Some skis that I've looked at and seem interesting, but I'm not sure how well they would fit:
- Volkl Revolt 95
- Atomic Bent Chetler 100
- Line Sick Day 88 and 94
- K2 Marksman (maybe a bit too wide)
- Fischer Ranger 94 FR or 102 FR
- Black Crows Camox

First Time Skiier - How much to spend on clothes?,"Hello everyone,

I will hopefully be going to Les Deux Alpes in January for my first time skiing, gonig for 7 days, taking lessons etc. I have been researching gear and read the sidebar and it recommends membranes and breathabilities of 10-15000 for jacket and salopettes, and merino wool for socks and base layers etc. These are all quite expensive! I want to stay warm and dry of course, but I have a budget, do I really need such high tech gear for skiing perhaps one week a year (especially when I am new). If this becomes an annual event I'm sure I will invest in better equipment eventually.

I am hoping to stick to a budget of £200 for everything, so hopefully, that will cover jacket, trousers, socks, gloves, base layers and mid layers.  Also how many pairs of socks/base layers/midlayers should I need for 6 days of skiing?

Skiing VT questions,"Hi,

I'm planning on visiting VT with my girlfriend in late January and want to ski. I've never skiid (skiied?) before but she's pretty solid. I have played hockey my whole life and was told it's somewhat similar to skating. I plan on going once or twice where I live prior to going to get a feel for it.

I was wondering if you had any suggestions for a place to ski, that's relatively low tourist but also somewhat beginner friendly. She wants to do more difficult runs and I would like to if I take to it well. I know I'm asking for the best of both worlds, but just curious if anyone knows of places that fit this description.

Also, I know this is probably for the Vermont subreddit, but we'll be there a week and any must go to cities/towns/nature areas would be awesome to hear about as well. Thank you!

I need some advise about free ride skis,"So recently I have started working and gotten enough money to buy a new pair of ski's. I've been wanting to buy freeride skis and now is the time.

So I am making this post to get some advise and opinions about these types of skis. It is almost emberrasing for me to ask but I know there are a lot of you much more experienced than I am. And frankly I dont have the experience needed to know for sure what I want.

A little bit about me: I am a Landes 1 level ski teacher (178cm length, 75kg) with 2 full seasons of experience who skis and teaches on Atomic Double Deck GS 172cm 16,5m radius skis. These skis are ofcourse fantastic for carving and on slope skiing but they are very heavy in the offpiste. 

What I am looking for is a ski which can make the offpiste an even more enjoyable experience. But the ski also has to be decend on the slope and I plan on using it on the piste on days it is snowing a lot as well. At the end of the day there will be lots of little bumps with perhaps some icy parts in between and I need the ski to handle itself in those situations as well. I will only use these skis in Europe

I am looking for tips with how wide of a ski I should be looking at as well as some suggestions on brands/models. It will not become my main ski (I will keep my GS for that) and therefor I dont feel the need to buy the most expensive option.

Beginner Question - Which Skis??,"A little backstory. I don’t know anything about skiing, I’m a climber but working at a ski resort this winter trying to get better. I’ll be working as a liftie so I kinda have to have skis. 

Currently I have backcountry skis with tech bindings. I only have these because my ex was into skiing and bought them for me. I was under the impression I could ride the mountain in these just fine all winter, but only recently found out I cannot, as tech bindings cannot handle the beating of going downhill over and over again. 


Now I’m super stressed about money. It wasn’t in my budget at all to buy new skis. I thought I had that covered. I don’t even know anything about skis.


So my question is; should I sell the backcountry skis and boots to be able to afford ones better suited for the mountain? Or just wait and ride with the ones I have? My only problem with selling them is I don’t want to suddenly get into skiing more and then regret selling my backcountry ones. What are my options??",skiing,1570399748,333cacti,True,2019-10-06,1
Black Crows Anima vs Prior CBC,"Looking at picking up one of these two skis for resort pow/chop, sidecountry, and maybe even a little bit of park. They both appeal to me for similar reasons. Stiff flex combined with close to center mount point seems like the perfect combination for my skiing style. The CBC is stiffer in the tips and tails, but it also has a more centered mount point and a more playful shape, so I'm not sure how that will equate to on-snow stability.

5-day lift pass for a destination of your choice (among 41) whenever you want until Oct. 2020 [USD500],"So I bought a season pass for [CLASSIFIED] and I got several goodies with it, among which is a 5-day pass for any one of the [ikonpass](https://www.ikonpass.com/en/shop-passes/ikon-pass-2019-2020) destinations. I don’t need it so I figured I’d offset the cost of the pass a bit. The best thing about it: you choose when and where to go! No blackout dates! Ikonpass offers 41 destinations, so you have plenty to choose from. Here’s how it works:

1. Send me a PN to discuss further details. 

2. I’ll send you a promo code along with an email and a phone number you can call to redeem it. The phone number belongs to ikonpass.

3. Pick up your pass and have fun skiing!

I’d recommend you call them because I don’t really know how this works myself tbh. I assume that you just give them the promo code I’ll send you, tell them where and when you wanna go and they’ll have the pass ready for you at the lift station when you get there.

One-Ski Quiver for Both Coasts (2018-2019 Model),"I'm looking to buy my first pair of skis for this season, but am really struggling on what width range to go for.

I am originally from the Midwest but attend college in the east coast, so I ski the west coast when I'm home for winter break and the east coast while I'm back for spring semester.

I am 5'10"" and around 165 lbs. I would say I am an advanced skier, who spends most of his time off-piste. I love tree runs,  crud/variable snow, moguls, and anything else; however, I still want a ski that can carve somewhat well when I undoubtedly end up on groomers.

I was looking at skis like the Salomon QST 99, Nordica Enforcer 100, Head Kore 99, or the Blizzard Rustler 10/Bonafide, but now I'm worried that those widths will be too wide for the groomers out east and am now considering the 90-95 mm options for these models.

If I purely skied out west this would be an easy decision, but I don't know how much I should let my east-coast skiing affect my decision. I want to enjoy the west coast to its full potential but not be miserable in the east coast when there's little snow cover.

Question to those who ski with their family?,"&amp;#x200B;

I’m considering setting up social media page(s) to offer a ski clothing swap scheme.

I just felt like I’d discuss this with ski-fanatics in this community for your opinion, ideas and thoughts. Do you think this is a good idea and has the potential to really get a big following? I’m still in the very early stages of creating a plan but I imagine this will grow fastest on a Facebook group. Originally I’ll set up a:

* Facebook page

Ski Bag Recommendations,"I need a ski bag to fly out west with, and I see a few options I like but all seem to have mixed reviews. Now, many of these reviews seem to be something like ""the brake poked through"", and I fully intend to wrap a large rubber band around them to prevent them from poking out, so hopefully that helps mitigate a lot of the concerns. 

My needs: Need for air travel (max 2 trips per year), 2 ski bag, needs to fit boots and some clothing, but I don't mind carrying a majority of the clothing. Would like to use for the weekend-warrior car rides to prevent beating up my seats, but not necessary. 

I like the Dakine roller bags (Boundary and the Fall Line), but I can't help but notice - other than the Boundary being slightly larger and being able to fit more, is there really a difference that justifies the price? Is there more padding?

I built a new jobs website for ski resort towns,"Ski Resort Jobs is a jobs website for ❄️ski resort towns. A new tool to connect ski resort employers with seasonal workers and ski town locals, advertising their jobs to a targeted audience within the industry. 

[https://skiresortjobs.co](https://skiresortjobs.co)

&amp;#x200B;

I have been living in ⛷️ ski resort towns for over 5 years and have seen the difficulty employers have hiring staff and built a new tool to help.  Under-staffing is a huge issue in most ski resort towns due 💲 pricey accommodation options and the 🏔️ remote locations of the towns. With Ski Resort Jobs, employers can advertise their jobs not only to their local towns, but also to current and prospective ski resort dwellers around the 🌎 world to help them find suitable applicants.  

&amp;#x200B;

On the job seeker side, there are many companies who actually charge between $500-$1500 to find someone a ski resort job. I do not agree with this 😤 and think it should be 😄 free to find a job seeing as there are always so many vacancies in ski resort towns. So my goal here is to increase awareness and exposure of these jobs and also make it easy to filter by 📍 location and job category so they can find the best job for their preferences.  

&amp;#x200B;

Hear the ⛄ mountains calling you? Check the site out and you might find a cool job to get you set up for a great 🏂 winter season!

Looking for the perfect skis for New England skiing!,"I only ski in New England, and currently use Salomon Q-85 skis. I love the Q-85s when there is fresh powder and perfect snow. But, when I hit ice, I feel like they're the wrong tool for the job. Although they go fast on uneven ungroomed terrain and are easy to keep under control at high speeds, they are also big and heavy, which makes them pretty tiring for me to use at high speeds on normal groomed terrain. I love glades, but again, they are big and heavy, and I really feel like they hinder my ability to safely navigate the trees. Moguls; I'd love to more of, but doing them in the Q-85s is just too exhausting for me to have any fun. 

I still plan to use the Q-85s when there is fresh powder, because they are so much fun for that. But, I ski when I can, and so I very rarely get to ski on fresh powder. I need something that excels general purposes and is tailored to the conditions found most often in New England. Something that can handle a bit of ice, does well at high speeds (I like to go fast), and is light/maneuverable enough for me to hop around glades and even moguls.

My skill level would probably be intermediate-advanced. I can ski all the trails at every New England ski resort no problemo. Mont Treblant in Quebec had some challenging stuff for me, but still loved even their toughest trails (If you live in the northeast and never gone skiing there: you gotta). Never been out west.

HELP Are my boots too worn in?,"Bought a pair of Salomon X-Pro 100s for last season; I was working at a hotel in the Alps so was skiing almost every day. At the start of the season my boots felt really good, but over the course of the season it seemed that I wore them in to the point where I had to wear an extra layer of thick socks to get them to fit properly. By the end of the season I was having real issues particularly off-piste, as the boot just didn't feel dialled at all - I would ski with my toes scrunched up sometimes to get that sense of control that I wanted. Is there any way I can rescue my boots? A new lining? Re-molding the current lining? Or will I just have to get a new pair of boots? 

My other issue is that I own a pair of Black Crows Atris. This might be a really stupid question, but the bindings were mounted using my current boots so if I bought a new pair of different sized boots, would I still be able to use these skis?

Insurance Provisions of Epic vs. Ikon,"We've all likely seen quite a few comparisons between the Ikon Pass and the EpicPass, including the various types of sub-pass. One thing that rarely gets mentioned is the optional insurance included. This is likely because insurance is complicated and even finding the full policies isn't super easy. 

**DISCLAIMER:** I'm just a guy trying to figure these things out. You take my analysis entirely at your own discretion, and I'm not responsible if you get screwed on the basis of my understanding.

---
**Cost** (% of Pass Cost)

Epic:

* EpicPass: $32 (3.3%)
* EpicLocal, Epic Day, Veteran Epic: $27 (3.8% of Local)
* Most others: $17

Ikon: 

* Ikon: $63 (5.9% of Adult, 8% of Young Adult)
* IkonBase: $45 (6% of Adult, 8% of Young Adult)

---
**Coverage**

Both appear to cover similar things. You need to get hurt badly enough or sick enough that a doctor says you can't ski, a family member is hurt/sick enough *you* can't go ski, you have to transfer your employment more than 100 miles away, you get pregnant. 

---
**Daily Fee/Pro-rated**

Both insurance will prorate your insurance payout. The EpicPass and EpicLocal will reduce your payout from the maximum (how much you paid for the pass itself) $95 for most of the big resorts, $50 for Stowe, Stevens, Okemo, $35 for the tiny midwest mountains. 

If you mostly ski the big mountains, your payout is reduced by 9.8% of the full amount each time you ski. After 10 days you will receive no refund at all. For the EpicLocal it's an even worse deal: your payout is reduced 13% of the full amount each time you ski, and you get basically nothing after 7 days of skiing.

Ikon Pass will also reduce the payout, but by ???? amount. I've read through the [full insurance policy](https://rsportalcanada.archinsurancesolutions.com/description-of-coverage/026f3754-7174-e611-8f21-005056002a0f.pdf) and the closest I can get is

&gt;We will reimburse You, up to the Maximum Benefit Amount shown in the Schedule of Benefits, for the pro-rated cost of the
remaining portion of the Covered Season Pass purchased, less any refunds received, which You purchased for the
Season Pass Coverage Period

and for Schedule of Benefits:

&gt;Season Pass Interruption............................................................................................................. Pro-rated Season Pass Cost

My *interpretation* of that is some amount based on when you bought the policy to the end of the season, but it's not clear to me. Perhaps we have some insurance people who can help out?

---

**Analysis**

The reason to get insurance of this type is likely because you want to be covered in the event of preseason injury, from when you bought the pass until you started skiing. That's particularly true of the EpicPass, which has benefits that are hugely reduced the more you ski. It's possible the Ikon benefits are reduced to that degree too, but I can't figure out how much.

One alternative, far more flexible way to ""insure"" yourself for preseason mishaps is to wait as long as you can to buy the pass. The ""price"" will be the increase cost of the pass for waiting, which will likely exceed the cost of insurance. But it will ""cover"" far more preseason things like simply changing your mind. 

Still, if you buy your EpicPass in April/May for the increased benefits (summer access, buddy passes), I think the 3% insurance is probably worth it. If you're buying it now or in November, I'm not sure I'd suggest it but it's a small enough fee that you might feel better about it.

I'm not sure I can recommend the same for the IkonPass. 6% of the total pass amount is pretty steep, and would be circumstance dependent (e.g. if you're trying to get pregnant, think you might be relocated by your job, etc.). 

One last consideration: getting an insurance payout for these things tends to be a pain in the neck, if they even end up covering it to begin with. Factor that into your calculation because it definitely reduces the perceived benefit to me.

Anyway, hope this helps. Again, this is just me trying to wrap my head around something I did not have a good grasp on before.",skiing,1570720789,zorastersab,True,2019-10-10,1

Shopping dilemma: SuperShape I.Titan VS V-Shape V4,"Greetings all,

I am skiing for over 20y on already 10 years outdated skis that done their job for all this time.   
Had no problems really except I couldn't keep up speed at cornering without leaning too much (unlike others) otherwise I'd lose grip/control and would have to back off a bit.   


Last year went in Serre Chevalier and one circumstance led to another, i forgot my boots and tried on new Head V Shape skis I think, not sure, and I was mesmerized by the difference. I never thought a ski can make that much difference.   


This year I am determined to get new skis before I go in Val Thorens and my dilemma is between the: 

500 euro SuperShape I.Titan VS 250 euro V-Shape V4 (BOTH SKIS ARE ON -50%) 

I see the supershape Titan is for all conditions, while the V-Shape would give me more confidence (enough) but as ... what can i say, 20y exp skier what these skiis can offer me in terms of performance?

Is it worth it to go and get the 500 euro skis, or the 250 ones?   
If anyone could give me an idea, it would really help me

"Have a job in Squaw Valley, CA as a Ski instructor - I’m 18yo and am looking for tips/advice.","Hi everyone, I recently decided as of this point in life I cannot be doing a 4 year college stay, I’m too young and I want to enjoy my youth and semi-healthy body.

I’ve been skiing my entire life - I remember the first time I skied my legs went inward and I fell, now I fucking love it. I live in NY, and am more than capable of skiing every trail at the resorts I visit.

However, CA looks a lot different in regards to terrain. I am not used to huge drops at all unless it’s a jump.

My question is - how can I gain stability and strength when attempting to maneuver over these large rock sides. It’s always been a dream of mine to ski things like this, and i cannot wait to try it out. Workouts? Exercises? Practice? 

One thing I’ve noticed in my 10+ seasons of skiing is I have trouble landing large drops. I can do it most of the time and rarely fall, but I’m worried it’s going to be a hard obstacle out there. 

Another thing - what is everyone’s personal recommendations for skis out there. As a teen I really didn’t pay attention or listen to what the people helping me buy my skis would say, now I realized I should’ve. I would prefer skinnier skis, as the bulky wide ones I used this last season weren’t too agile.

Ikon Base - First Week of Dec. trip - Banff/Revel? JH/MT?,"So I am planning a trip first week of Dec. to go somewhere out West (Live in NY) with my Ikon base.

I'd hit Calgary--&gt;SkiBig3 + Stoke, go up through Jasper then to Edmonton and back to Calgary for the Alberta trip.

Need help deciding on new skis,"I'm currently looking to buy a new pair of skis. Some background info:

* 5' 10"", 180 lbs
* Advanced-expert (definitely closer toward expert)
* I almost only ski the Rockies (think Big Sky, Bridger, and a bit of Alta)
* I prefer skiing powder and trees somewhat aggressively. I rarely ever ski groomers or moguls.
* I don't care about park performance, I already own a pair of park skis.
* I'm looking for something &gt;105mm waist, but not over 112mm (this is somewhat flexible, so if you think a ski is a good fit for me but is outside of this range, that's fine)

I don't want skis that require maximum aggression 100% of the time. I'd rather go for something that I can push hard around 70% of the time but doesn't lack when not skiing ultra-aggressively. Ideally, I'll use these for mostly big mountain skiing. I want something that I can charge, but also something that is stable enough for variable conditions and cliffs.

Some skies I've been looking at:

* J skis the Metal (my main concern is their lack of stiffness)
* Black crows Atris (seems like it might lack a bit at higher speed and aggression)
* 4FRNT MSP (seems like a variant of the Atris)
* Line vision 108 (seems a little too touring-oriented, but I could be wrong here)

North Face FutureLight - has anyone tried it?,"I'm due to grab a new North Face ski jacket and pants this year, and have seen the huge marketing push they're putting behind the new FutureLight fabrics. I've read a few online reviews but to be honest they seem a bit advertorial in nature, so would love to hear more from someone who's tried any of this gear.


Key points I'd like to understand:
* How waterproof is the fabric? The marketing talks around ""most breathable waterproof fabric ever"", but on all fabrics to date this usually means better breathability but reduced waterproofing (balanced appropriately for the sport in question).
* How windproof is the fabric? This to me seems one of the key points that's missing from all reviews. Am I going to dump a ton of heat when the wind gets up? Doesn't sound ideal for those bitter 5 minutes riding the older chairlifts...
* How durable is the fabric? Some of the previous iterations of 3L Steep Series jackets have been pretty burley, but the FutureLight reviewers seem less confident in stating this. I always try to take care of my gear but it's not something you want at the back of your wind when you're cutting down a tree line...

Help with Visa!,"Hey guys,

I’m from UK and have applied for the International Experience Canada (IEC) Visa roughly 3 weeks ago.

I’ve informed the employer which stage of the process I am at, and I have since received two offers to work in Whistler. I am now getting nervous I will not be able to get my visa on time, and hence not be able to fulfil my employment.

I’ve tried contacting the Canadian Consulate in London who referred me to an enquiry form on the Canadian governments website, but as I’ve not been selected yet they have automatically dismissed my inquiries. Both the Consulate and the government don’t seem to take inquires in person nor on the phone, so these are out the window.

Any help on how to speed up this process, if at all possible will be greatly appreciated. I was just wondering if the fact that I have offers of employment may allow me to speed this up.

Thanks in advance :)",skiing,1570140462,Harryb933,True,2019-10-03,1
How much better can you get at freestyle skiing over the course of a season as a beginner?,"When I say beginner, I mean a freestyle beginner. I am an intermediate skier, getting around to being confident around most slopes and kind of want to take things into the park.

Just wanted to vent something.,"This past Spring, I went skiing with my family in Colorado. It was a great trip, save for one day. After I was getting back into it for the first day, (I only have the chance to ski a few times a year) I decided to hit up some more difficult terrain. There’s this nice, somewhat powdery mogul run right down underneath the main lift for that part of the mountain. I cruised down for a bit, took a turn, and my ski popped off. Put it back on, took another turn, it popped straight off. After a look-around, the DIN was around 5. I’m a big guy, so that’s not where you want to be for a fairly competent skier. Since I had no clue how to adjust it, I walked down the last 100 or so feet of slope. Then it happened. This kid, with his dad, shouted down from the chair- “No one wants a weakass quitter like you!” I heard the dad sniggering as they were carried overhead. I was stunned, It never occurred to me that people could be so randomly cruel, especially a 10 year old. 

TLDR: Bindings malfunctioned, kid insults me.

Torn Between Skis,"Hey y’all,

Currently planning my preseason splurge and have been pretty interested in the Elan Ripstick line!
I myself am 5’6, 130 lbs, intermediate, and a West Coaster. Not crazy about going fast *at all* and much prefer SL style turns. 
My go-to sticks are Black Pearl 88s in the 159 length, and my park planks are some Faction Prodigy 2.0x (96 underfoot) in the 164 length. 
I’ve been currently looking at the Ripstick 106s and 102s (the women’s version) and am pretty torn as to which length to go with. I feel comfortable on a longer ski such as the 167/163 but I understand for controllability I should really be sizing down and looking at the 157 length in the women’s line. 
This is my second season skiing so I really don’t know too much yet, looking for some insights on sizing and if the Ripsticks are a solid line to start with! Thanks!",skiing,1570233148,slipnslidenskid,True,2019-10-04,1

March ski trip to Austria help,"As I wait for the white stuff to start falling down, my thoughts turn to a way to make this ice-coast skier hit Austria for a week next March. 

Why March? Because I’m a teacher and the only other option is the first week of January — I did that last year in Chamonix and, on top of a lack of early-season snow, you don’t want to know what was the cost of a **** hotel room on Dec. 31st. 

This summer, I had the chance to visit parts of Germany (Munich!), $witzerland (Lucerne, not much skiing there) and Austria (I fell in love with Innsbruck...) In a bus from Innsbruck to Switzerland, on the Arlberg Schnellstraße, the exits rhymed off mythical names: St. Anton, Zürs, Lech. (Kitzbühel is in the other direction...)

OK, so Munich and I have unfinished business, such as a visit to the Deutsches Museum (science and tech, 17 km of walking if one goes through all the galleries...) Methinks landing in Munich and spending a day or two there might help with the jet lag. Then hop on a train (or rent a car) and then get to Innsbruck, or St. Anton or ??? for 5-6 days of skiing before flying back to North America. 

Looking for ideas, suggestions, recommendation.  Après is important to me and I don’t mind hitting the skin track in the morning to detoxify the bloodstream.

Women's Skis - Choosing my first pair,"Hello! I'm researching to buy my first pair of skis before this coming winter.

I'm a 5'4"" female, competent intermediate (maybe edging on advanced), and planning on skiing about 10 days a year, maybe 15 if I'm lucky. I'm based in California and would ideally like a quiver of 1 all-mountain ski, since I often encounter powder, crud, and hard snow on the same day. I prefer playing in the trees to racing down groomers and I love exploring, so I would like something light with a little float and small turning radius that can take me into almost any type of terrain. I still would like good control on groomers, but have no real need to go super fast. 

I want a ski I can have fun with that I won't grow out of quickly, but I'm not ready to spend big yet and I worry about purchasing a less wieldy pair when I don't ski more often. I've previously enjoyed skiing on a rental pair of 149mm Dynastar Glory 74's which helped me build confidence and has performed really well for me on all but the most extreme conditions, but I'm looking for a newer ski (one that's still in commission) and one less targeted to beginning skiers. I also prefer lighter and shorter skis, but I'm welcome to be debated on this. 

I've found a few models that look promising, but I'd love any input from the reddit community:

**Salomon QST Lux 92 (153)** (their 2018/2019 models are on big sale right now)

**Line Pandora 94 (151)**

**Elan Ripstick 102 W (156)** (kind of expensive, so I would have to find these on sale)

I also appreciate any suggestions on bindings, since at this point I know nothing.",skiing,1569778706,almostb,True,2019-09-29,1

Is this a good or bad deal? Please Help!,"&amp;#x200B;

**Background:** I've skied since I was little and live in Colorado currently however due to some life stuff I haven't skied in 2-3 seasons and no longer have my old skis. I have been looking around on the used market as I don't have tons of money currently and came across a posting for a pair of 2013 Rossignol s3's I have heard good things about them and am thinking of buying them maybe however I figured I could check here to see what you guys think.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/a/V1MUCI0) are the photos included in the listing the seller is asking for 300$.

I really am looking for a pair of cheaper but good ski's that will let me get back to skiing and essentially provide me a platform to figure out what type of skiing I like now.  So that I can buy some higher-end skis more geared in that direction and expand my quiver either this or next season. 

I looked up the bindings [HERE](https://www.gondyline.com/indemnified.php) and it looks as though the bindings included will still be serviced by shops.  (They are Marker Griffins)

Do you think this would be worth getting if not is there any recommendations you would have for me? I am 5'8 and 140lbs and really like tree skiing and bombing groomers my main mountains being Breckenridge and Loveland.

Recent Snow and Upcoming Season,"So I'm expecting a bunch if responses about how this is extremely unusual...but is the recent snow a sign of an upcoming La Nina winter? 


Does anyone remember the guy a few months ago that was predicting a La Nina year based off of some reading he was getting out on a research vessel? He was saying to expect a massive winter at elevations cold enough here in the PNW.

Another thing to consider, our rains here have been thick and heavy leading into fall. Normally you just get pissed on all rainy season. This year we have consistently had rain storms here. Couple inches a week kinda thing, at times. I believe we had the wettest July on record in Washington.

Being in a place that literally rains constantly for 8 months, snow is more of a matter of temp. We tend to hover at like 35F, but not at 7000 feet we don't. Crystal had a 400 inch winter last year. 

It just seems like if we have this level of precipitation continue into the cold then we'll be having a monster winter.

Last La Nina, Baker recorded 1100 inches.

That's 90 fucking feet of snow.

Need help with ski gear. Europe -&gt; Canada,"Hi all,

I am sorry for the long post (TLDR at the end), but bear with me please, as all of my ski gear started gradually fail on me for the past 3 years.  Currently, I basically do not own skis, boots nor goggles that are suitable for the upcoming season. The same can be said about my gloves and helmet, but that can wait. 
I was trying to postpone the buying process as I plan to move abroad, so it wasn’t very reasonable to buy everything new and then pay for the expensive shipping.

I am from Europe, raised on slopes of Austrian Alps and Czech hills. When I was a kid it was more about fresh powder but recently I enjoy very hard slopes more.

I am a 27 years old woman, 54kg, 5'10"" (177cm).  I think I am an advanced skier. 

I love groomed slopes and prefer aggressive skis with personality. My style is more about slalom carving but I love short turns as well.

Even though I am a boney woman I absolutely hate women’s skis. I tried a fair share of them in the past few years and they just don’t work for me. Usually, I don’t get from them the response I would like and they are too light for my taste.

I am moving in January to Vancouver BC,  where I hope will be plenty of opportunities to go skiing in Cypress mountain and maybe occasionally Whistler Blackcomb. Before that, I am heading for a week to the Austrian Alps in December and I don't want to rent skis and ski boots, as I hate not knowing the gear beforehand and I somehow don’t trust them (had some pretty bad past experience with a rental shop which basically destroyed my holiday). Plus I don’t want to spend more money on renting when I can invest more toward buying (ski rental for a week in the Alps is around 260 CAD without boots).
As my employer is paying for my relocation, I can take everything with me, so I can get my much-needed gear as soon as possible.

Before my current skis went to ski-heaven I loved and proudly owned Atomic Redster DoubleDeck SL. Last season I was renting Stockli Laser WRT and God did I loved the skis! I was going to buy them even if they were going to cost me a kidney. But now I am not sure if it is going to be a smart choice for BC ski slopes as I read that Europe and BC slopes are completely different.

The question is, which skis should I look at when it comes to brands/models for BC ski slopes? Do you have any recommendations? 
Is  it a correct assumption to expect that I will have to get used to more softer slopes than I am used to now?

What do you think about all-mountain skis? 
I personally never tried them and nobody that I know owns a pair. Around me, there is an assumption that you are losing something major with them being the compromise, but is it really that bad? 
Also, they are much cheaper compared to normal downhill skis, for some reason.

Another thing I wanted to ask, what length of skis would you recommend for me? I'm used to ski on 157cm, but now I was looking at skis around 165cm. Considering my heigh it was quite an OK length for carving skis, but I am not sure if that would work for all-mountain skis as well.

Also, do you have any recommendation for ski goggles? 

What is your opinion on Atomic Hawx Ultra ski boots? I rented them last season and really liked the performance of them, before them, I had like 10year old Salomon Quest something... 
Is Atomic good choice for somebody with extremely narrow feet or should I look for different brands? 

Sorry again for such a long post, I just don’t have many people I can ask for help and you can’t always trust everything you hear in shops as they sometimes prefer profit over what you really need, plus being 27 years old and woman never helps. They always end up trying to force me some intermediate level pink ladies skis and don’t really listen to my requirements.

TLDR:

* 27 years old woman, 54kg, 5'10"" (177cm), an experienced skier
- need skis (men/unisex types), ski boots, and goggles
- relocating from Europe to Canada, BC - need skis for different slope types 
- prefers harder slopes
- opinion on all-round skis?
- style: carving or small turns, high speed
- current skis: (rented) Stocli Laser WRT, (retired) Atomic Redster DoubleDeck SL
- boots: (rented) Atomic Hawx Ultra, (retired) Salomon Quest",skiing,1569880722,burnmail123,True,2019-09-30,1

New race skis. Should I lend old ones to a friend,"Hi all

Relatively new skier here. I am too excited for the upcoming season here in the western US. I’m currently at work just thinking about the mountains. 


I’m 5’10/5’11 and 185 lbs. my homie gave me a pair of his old race skis that are 165 cm. They’re in great condition and I am interested in using these. 

I have another friend who might need loaner skis. My older pair is 176 cm– I believe—. I’m a little apprehensive of loaning my skis because I know you need more than one type if you’re serious about your shit. This will be my first year owning two pairs and I was wondering when I should bust these out. Maybe it’s just because they’re new but I want to use them as much as possible. I know these probably won’t do me well on fresh powder days but as long as it’s not fresh powder should I opt for these? 

Theyre much shorter, stiffer and thinner than my other skis. I believe they’re about 10-15 cm shorter. 

I’m leaning towards keeping both. Worst case I’ll learn through trial and error. Maybe take both sets to the mountain the first few times. 

Thank yous

Being a ski instructor can be quite a bit of fun, improve your skiing significantly through cheap or free lessons, and provide a cheaper pass.

You do need to enjoy working with small kids as that is where most of the business is. 

To get started, contact the director of the ski schools that you are interested in. Or read the comments to see if there is more information about a ski school that operates near you.

So far I have thought of ideas such as a social event, ski trail familiarity tours, and a possible social media page for people to have their photos published. These would aim to help those that feel like they wouldn't know anyone else to ski meet new people, decrease intimidation of not knowing where to go or possibly getting lost on the hills, and let people feel like they are being recognized throughout the whole group no matter their skill level.

Outside of these few ideas, I hope to be able to do much more to make it a fun and exciting experience for everyone involved, and with that I would love some input from anyone and everyone else with ideas that you would personally enjoy if you were apart of the club as well.

Is 5 skiing days at Revelstoke too long or should I do 3 at Revvy and 3 at Fernie?,"I'm starting to my trip for next year. My wife and I are in our late 30s. We only get to ski once per year now. We are pretty decent. We've both been skiing for more than 20 years. I would say I'm a 7 with rust because of lack of hill-time with my wife being a 6. on a scale of 1 = newb to 10 = Ski Patrol. We are both, athletic and would be very good(8-9) skiers if we could only get more days on the hill. 
Anyway, the totally extreme stuff(hucking cliffs, long boot packs, etc...) is out of the question. If I'm understanding what I've read and seen on the trail maps, Revvy is mostly tree/glade skiing. I love glades and bumps! My wife is a little bit more conservative shall we say. She can get down pretty much anything short of Corbets, but it won't be pretty an will take a bit of time for her. I'm worried the terrain will just be too taxing for her and she'll get bored from having to stick to the same terrain she can ski over and over. No matter where I've been I've learned that we wind up sticking to smaller portions of mountains due to various factors like weather, snow-cover, staying away from ski-school hell and chopped up groomers, ability limits, etc... And because of those factors I'm worried I would get bored as well since a lot of the glades at Revvy seem pretty intense relegating me to the same areas over and over. 

So, to my question: **tl;dr: is 5 skiing days too much for Revvy or should I extend the vacay by a day and split between Revvy(3days) and Fernie(3 days)?**

Put another way: Is enough of the harder trails and gladed terrain easy enough for for level 6/7 skiers to last 5 days? Any comparison of terrain type and amount of it to Whistler, JH, and Breck would be welcome as those have been my most recent trips.",skiing,1568666689,csh8428,True,2019-09-16,1

Don't see much about hitch racks. I can see the pros of not having to get up high to get them on/off.  Any cons  other than the impact on opening the back hatch.  I know for bikes on an outback roof mount \~7mpg but rear \~2mpg

The bike-rack adapted hitch carriers keep the ski's board high which may impact wind more.

Ski shop miss mounted my brand new skis.,"I picked up some brand new faction ct 2.0 early summer and dropped them off at a ski shop in August to have my bindings get mounted. I spoke with the sales clerk and made it clear I wanted the “ all mountain” line for the bindings which is just the classic mount. Well I received a call yesterday they were ready and I went to go pick them up to find my bindings were center mounted. I told the lady they were center mounted and had me wait for awhile until she came back and told me they have to remount them and they will give me a call when they’re ready. What’s bothering me is if they have to remount the bindings and plug the prior holes, I don’t want to be skiing brand new skis and just see these plug holes while I ski. If I’m not happy with the plugs and ask them to reimburse me or replace the skis am I wrong ?

Problems with ski goggles? Room for improvement?,"Hey guys, 

I'm a design student at the University of Colorado and over the next couple weeks I'm going to be designing and prototyping the ideal pair of ski goggles because I don't think skiers should have to choose between visibility, protection, and comfort. 

I'd love to get any input on issues you face with your goggles while skiing. I want to make sure the product I design actually would be useful to skiers. 

I'm currently thinking about a small heating device that would keep the lenses warm (to prevent fogging) and the ability to quickly change the lens depending on whether you are facing sunny conditions or flat light. Would these be worthwhile innovations to you? (assuming the cost isn't crazy)

Also, if you have any ideas about what could be done to improve visibility, comfort, protection, or any other component of ski goggles that would be amazing.

Advice for those with disabled knees?,"I was blessed at birth with apparently shitty knees. Tore my ACL first when I was 11, repaired at 17, ongoing injuries since (now 21). As far as I know my repaired ACL is still in tact, but very, very loose. Ive had a couple of injuries since last winter, nothing torn afaik, but definitely realising that snowboarding this season may be plagued by these ongoing issues. The biggest problem is the joint laxity, it seems to partially dislocate laterally very easy. 

Im guessing there are many in this sub who have battled with shitty knees; my question to you, how should I prepare for the season? The more detailed the better as far as exercises. Ive investigated prolotherapy but its not affordable for me living in BC. Any other tips on keeping injury free are appreciated.

East Coast Epic Pass Skier - What weekend trip out west would be best?,"I'm an east coast skier, and I've never been out west. I would really like to try and make a 4 day weekend happen this year, even if it's just me. I'd probably rent an airbnb room or something or find someone who needs an extra for their trip. 

What's the best epic pass mountain to head out west and hit, especially if I'm only going to have 2-3 days on the mountain itself? I'm not afraid of anything groomed on east coast ice. I can handle myself in some moderate trees without significant steeps, and I plan to get better as the season progresses - that said, it seems like the west coast has more steeps but its less dense forests. I don't care about park. 

I was thinking maybe one-two days each at one of the following options (or whatever makes sense): 

Option 1. Breck/Keystone
Option 2. Vail/BeaverCreek
Option 3. Heavenly/Northstar
Option 4. Snowbasin (alone)

I have no idea when I'll be able to get out there again, so I want to make 1 or 2 trips this year and use up some vacation time.

First time true off-piste in Chamonix,"Hello. 

I’m an advanced-ish skier (never took lessons or had a test done, but I’m fully comfortable on any piste, although I do go slower than others on double blacks) and I’m heading for Chamonix this winter. Insanely excited. I like doing tree runs and off-piste by myself, but up until now I’ve only done these things inside a resort, between pistes, so that I never needed to worry about avalanches and stuff like that. 

I’m going to Chamonix alone (I love solo skiing) and I was wondering how I should go about skiing true off-piste (the Vallée Blanche is definitely something I want to do) for the first time. I’m a student and don’t have any cash to spare (most of my money is already going to this trip lol) so I couldn’t afford a week of lessons or to buy extremely expensive avalanche gear. 

I could probably rake up enough cash to go with a guide in a group for a day or two though. Would that be recommended?

Suggestions for new skis?,"I have a set of 2015 Line Supernatural 92’s that I really love. However, they are starting to get a little beat up. 100+ days of east coast skiing (and a few days out West) which includes the occasional rough woods skiing. Definitely still usable, but thinking of either replacing them with fresh sticks this year or adding another set and using them as a bad-condition backup. (Which, by the way, when do you know skis are done?)

They’re the best skis I’ve owned and would like to maintain some of the characteristics. I love how stable they are in groomers and varying condition. I don’t have a comparison point for woods and moguls but they seem to work OK there too. Room for improvement, maybe lighter, maybe wider for out west trips? Oh, and I’m a cheapo so I’d be looking at getting some previous year models at a discount. 

Skiing is 90% east coast. 80-90% on piste and duck into the woods whenever conditions are nice. I try to do a little woods skiing every time out. Epic Pass so I’ll be at Mt Snow, Okemo, Stowe, and a few days out west. The only days I avoid are when it’s a total sheet of ice or rain but I tend to ski every weekend. 

The newer Line Sick Days seem interesting. I’m not sure what has changed on the Supernaturals since then but could get another set of those, maybe wider.

I'm 5'9 and weigh 140 (22 years old so Im not gonna get any taller) and typically rent in the 160cm range of skis.

Basically, I'm looking for advice on what length/underfoot I should aim towards that will suit my current intermediate skill level but will accommodate me getting a bit better in the coming seasons. Like I said earlier, I do a mix of groomers/powder.

I've been eyeing these in 160s and would greatly appreciate any advice https://www.evo.com/ski-packages/rossignol-smash-7-skis-xpress-10-bindings

Question: how bad is carving ski for powder?,"Hi all,

I live in New Zealand, and often ski in hard snow or ice. Recently bought a Voelkl Deacon 74 and I love it. It work perfectly for NZ snow condition. However I am wondering do this ski feel bad if I bring it to oversea like Japan or Canada?  I often hear how carving ski is bad for powder because of how narrow it is to stay afloat. So i am hestitating to bring it oversea that may actually ruin my experience compare to local rental.  this kinda affect my decision of travel luggage and rental...etc.

Some more background story for myself: i have been skiing for over 8 years and quite confident in groomed trail in high speed (my app say i reached 97km/h, no idea how accurate is it but you can use it as refrence lol). 

But I also have very little experience with powder snow. Powder in NZ is almost like non existent (unless you lucky enough to go to ski the next day after big snow dump. and even having a dump, we  won't have powder deeper than like 20cm).",skiing,1568287464,jk2l,True,2019-09-12,1

First Boots and Skis,"Hey everyone, I was looking for some advice for a skier that's new to purchasing their own gear. 

Intermediate/Advanced Skier, 5'10, 173lb

I have a trip planned to Vail for 9 days in December. My girlfriend and I have been skiing demo skis and boots for a few years now and are now ready to purchase our first set of skis and boots. We were looking for an all mountain ski. We primarily do black and double black groomed runs, and also spend about 80% of our time in the bumps/moguls. 10% trees and maybe 10% ungroomed. I narrowed our skis down to a couple of Blizzards (Bushwhacker for me and Black Pearl for her). We really want our own boots as it's hit or miss with the ones we rent and sometimes my feet are miserable at the end of our trips. 

I'd like to be able to purchase the boots and skis and be able to pick them up with bindings mounted and get fitted for boots, all in the same day if possible, so I'm trying to figure out how to go about doing that. 

So far, my thoughts are purchasing the skis remotely in advance with an outfitter and getting bindings installed so that I can pick them up the day we arrives. After that, would you recommend finding a good boot fitter for a fitting/purchase and schedule the afternoon getting fitted for our new boots? Are there any quality places that can facilitate all of the above? I'm not worried about the cost as long as the service is worth it.

Boot fitting,"Im an advanced snowboarder now living in Park City, UT. I decided that since I'm here now if like to learn can to ski to have another tool in the arsenal. Ive been to four bootfitters and heard different things from each one. I'm 5'9"" 160lbs with a size 9 foot (wear size 9 Snowboard boots). I usually wear 9.5 in sneakers because my toes feel a bit crammed otherwise.

1st (shop):
I'm a 26.5 with a bit wider forefoot than normal and low ankle/shin/calf volume. Recommended a Salomon Xmax.

2nd (shop):
I'm a 26 with a normal width foot and should look for a 98 last.

3rd (shop):
I'm a 26 with a slightly wider than normal foot and wanted to put me in a Fischer rc4 the curv 110.

4th (surefoot machine):
I'm a 25.5 with a 2mm wider left foot and a 1mm longer right foot with a bit wider than normal width. He wanted to put me in a 25.5 Lange SX 120.

I'm not sure who to believe here and I know some personal bias probably plays into the decision. I can pick up a 25.5 Lange SX 120 for $300 and take it to the bootfitter of my choice to make adjustments and custom mold an orthotic (which id also use in my snowboarding boot). If the bootfitter said the 25.5 was too short for me or the last was too wide for me, I could always return it.

Does anyone have any advice on this situation? I do believe my forefoot is a bit wider than normal as I've always had trouble with regular shoes (and snowboard boots).

New Skier - Looking for Advice!,"Hi everyone! Newb here. I am wanting to get into skiing a little later in life- I’ll be 33 in a couple of weeks. My friends and boyfriend are very much into skiing so, of course, I became exposed to it. 

I do have a few hang ups though and am looking for advice/guidance. I am a larger female skier- 5’7.5”, 220lbs. I don’t wish to make this a post about my health or needing to drop weight to ski better- for the record I started at 420 lbs (not a typo) and am looking to be more active outside in the winter. I absolutely get it- skinny people are better skiers. I am looking for pointers on beginner ski size and really any advice you can throw at me as a newbie! I have the time, interest, and dedication to want to do this and would so appreciate any thoughtful responses. :)

I have tried skiing once before at Cranmore with  rented 146” Elan Delights. I am still trying to nail down stopping and control. They had me in 28.5 boots which I think were potentially a little big for me- I wear size 42 eur/11 women’s.

The 130 would obviously be better for carving, but I like to drop cliffs so I’m worried they may be too stiff. Plus, I like [the color](https://www.dalbello.it/en/boots/all-mountain/panterra-120-id-gw-7304/) of the 120s better.",skiing,1568576158,xXdrgnslyrXx007,True,2019-09-15,1
How to be a ski instructor in Japan,"I (23M) am a fresh graduate from the UK, just finishing off my masters degree over the next two weeks then I will be finally finished. I want to become a ski instructor out in Japan hopefully this season if possible.

I have been looking at jobs and most require some form of level 1 or 2 BASI qualification as a prerequisite however I have heard from other people that it is possible to complete your training while out there which would be ideal but would come at a cost. I could complete the level 1 before the season starts as I have some savings however may risk not finding a job in time.

Does anyone have any experience in japan, recommendations for good companies or simply advice on which would route would be best to take?

Looking for a playful all-mountain ski,"Hey,

I also posted this on NS, but I'm looking for a playful all mountain ski with a bit of flex, but that I can still use to rip around groomers when I'm chasing friends. I've done a fair amount of research on a number of skis, but still can't decide what would work best for me.

I'm 6'5, but I only weigh 190lbs, so I've been a bit concerned about the weight of the skis being an issue. I predominantly ski the French Alps, so it's a bit of a mixture of terrain, but not a heap of park, although I would definitely like to do a bit more. I've been skiing since I was four, so I'm pretty comfortable everywhere. My current skis are an old pair of the 188cm, 108 width Rossignol Soul 7s that I got for a song a few years back before I went to Japan, but I'm in the market for something more interesting/playful.

Here are the skis I've been looking at so far, and a few concerns I've got with each:


ON3P Kartel/Jeffery 108s - slightly worried about weight and that I'd be better getting something a different width to my S7s

ON3P Kartel/Jeffery 96s - wondering whether at my height I'd be better with the wider 108 option, but probably my first choice right now

Moment PB&amp;J - heard great things, but that they're quite stiff, and I want to learn how to butter which is putting me off a bit

J Skis Vacation - absolutely love the topsheets, but seems like they're a bit too soft for ripping around, and I swear J used to offer free international shipping... US$200 for shipping is tough to swallow. Also the 186 is going to run very short for me I think.

19/20 Line SFBs - concerned that the flex is going to be too noodle-y for anything other than jibbing, but since these are this year's skis I'm guessing no one outside the reviewers has skied them unless someone got to demo?

Armada ARV 106 - these seem to be sort of the middle of the road option - decent at everything, but I'd be interested to hear more

J Skis Metal - solves some of my problems with the vacation, but they also don't go above 186, which when you're my height is a bit of a problem - also don't love the new topsheets as much as some of the previous editions in all honesty - god I wish I'd bought Ridgeline when I first saw it, even if they are too short. Summit and Exposure were also amazing.

Gore Shakedry as a hard shell - bad idea?,"I normally wear 3 layer Gore Tex hardshell jacket and pants. But to simplify my wardrobe, I'm looking to get rid of the 3 layer set and replace it with a 2 layer Gore Shakedry.

A Gore Shakedry is basically a 3 layer with the outer 3rd layer removed. So it only has the Goretex film as the outer layer and the next to skin layer as the 2nd layer.

The advantage of getting rid of the outer 3rd layer is it's more breathable and prevents wetting out or frosting that can sometimes happen in 3 layers.

So going with shakedry, you have a hardlayer that can work all seasons
Breathable and wind and water proof in the summer (say when jogging in the rain) and winter. 

The disadvantage is, without the outer 3rd layer, there's no protection for the Goretex film from branches when skiing in trees.

Black crows (atris) length vs weight and height,"Hi!

Saw a previous post about lenghts versus height but im in bit of a pickle.

Defineteley going for the atris this season but struggling with going for either 189 or the 184. Im a fairly aggressive skier, but likes to cruise the woods in powder aswell as hitting couloirs in fairly high speed. (seem like atris is a perfect fit)

The question though is, im 182 cm and weigh ca. 65 kg. Though the guide at Black Crows say definetely go for 189 if im an aggressive skier above 175 cm. This does not account for that im fairly light weighted. My past skis have both maybe felt a bit to long, both animas at 188 and kye 110 at 188. Especially the kye 110 felt a bit long and thats why i landed on getting my ski length reduced to something similar to my height, thats why i initially chose 184, but seeing that the atris is rocker both front and back and the kye 110 is not, im having second thoughts.

Bindings advice: MBS Powerrail vs Attack2.,"Hi everyone.

I'm lower intermediate, not aggressive. I own a couple of system skis maxing out at 80. 

I've been eyeing a pair of Fischer Pro MT 86s since last spring. I loved the Pro Mt 80s but wanted something stiffer and wider. These are not system skis. 

I ended up finding them in one place with MBS12 bindings, and on another with Attack2-13 bindings. At the time, the first was somewhat cheaper so I went with that option. However, after reading a bit more about the two types of bindings I've gathered that there are significant differences. I had thought the MBS was mostly for rentals (with the easy adjust) but mostly like the Attack, but after reading a bit it seems like they might be mounted differently (heavier,higher/etc) and may have a different safety profile.

Should I return the set I already have and get the other? Would it even matter at my level?

Rossignol Experience 88Ti vs Nordica Enforcer 93,"Hiya,

I've been kicking around the idea of buying my first pair of skis. I started skiing seriously last season, and progressed to confidently doing black diamonds. I used rentals for the first couple of days, and then demos, I ended up using the shop's 88tis for most of the season, but at nearly 900$ I found it difficult to buy them (at the time), even discounted to 650$ for a demo pair. I did however find the binding high by about 3-5mm, it was an odd on-stilts feeling, compared to nearly on-the-board feeling of cheapo rentals.

I'm located in NY, most of my skiing is local, 90-100% on piste. 6'2"", 280lb (might be 260-270 by the time the season starts). 

I'm thinking of buying skis that I can use to grow into, been steadily losing weight and weight lifting, hoping get confident enough to do park at some point in the next couple of years with a long term goal of pulling off serious air, skiing switch, and maybe a backflip before I turn 35 (got a couple years still), but that's neither here nor there.

Trying to decide between Rossignol Experience 88Tis in 180cm, or Nordica Enforcer 93s in 185cm.

I have tried the Exp 84 Ci, found them entirely too soft, and ate way too much shit on them to feel comfortable.

Any clues or suggestions? I'm open to other skis too, ideally under the 750$ with bindings mark.

&amp;#x200B;

Side-note: Hilariously a friend of mine's dad gave me his old Rossi Crosscut 10.4 in 177cm, but I think these things are from 2008 or before. He bought them as beaters to hit tree runs, used them once, the edges are rusted to hell, but the bindings are good. I don't wanna really try em on anything but a green, most likely will just hang them as a decoration somewhere xD",skiing,1568119763,thebadgerfish,True,2019-09-10,1

Head Kore 99 189 vs 105 180,"Hey, looking to get a good pair of skis for the upcoming season and ive pretty much decided to go for the Head Kore series.

99mm would be better on piste, the length probably fits me better(?) and they might even float better because of the extra length(?) but theyre also more expensive. Fuck me i cant decide, what do you think would be the best buy?",skiing,1567291191,SweetChi1i,True,2019-08-31,1

Hand Me Down Used Skis - What to do?,"Intermediate skier here, never owned any skis as I always rented.

Got myself used skis and boots from a friend for $100 (same height and boot size, boot fit well and it was so cheap might as well buy it).

It's a 2012 model but he's only used them exactly 5 times, all in 2012/13 and hasn't and they're in great shape (barely a single scratch).

Telluride gondola shut down for fall,"I know this isn't exactly skiing related, but it is about a ski resort, so here it goes.  I'm planning a drive from Moab back to Denver this fall and thinking about a stop in telluride on the way through. Just so happens that we would be in telluride on oct 20 and that's the date the goldola shuts down for the shoulder between summer and winter ops. Does this mean it's open that day (Sunday) and closes for the season that night? Or is the last operating day is the day before and the Sunday is the first day of the shutdown season? I know they have a bus between mountain village and telluride proper, so I'm not specifically concerned with getting around, more so what's open or closed for the season.

Shift MNC bindings?,"I just bought some bent chetler 120s and was talked into (by my gf) getting a pair of Shift bindings to go with them.

I got the bent chetlers to get roudy with. My gf convinced me to get shift so i could take them backcountry too, if i wanted. Which sure, that may be really fun to do.

But will i be dealing with pre releases every time i try to do tricks and get air in the resort? Some threads online suggest that the shifts have prerelease issues. I got them with the impression they are good alpine bindings as well as tech bindings.

But now im concerned that im going to spend 55 days in the resort dealing with prereleases and wont be able to ski the chetlers hard like i wanted.

I havent mounted the shifts yet, so there is still time. 

What is your opinion on the shift binding for 91/9 resort/backcountry usage? Will i regret them at the resort? Would it be weird to always ski them with an alpine boot?",skiing,1567706383,reParaoh,True,2019-09-05,1

Boots for statistical outliers?,"Hello,

I'm a 6'6"" male, but hilariously I have very small feet for my height. Because the leg support of boots scales proportionally to the size of your feet, all the boots I've ever owned have had woeful leg support. The equivalent analogy would be if someone with normal body proportions were skiing with a pair of ankle boots. (a bit of an exaggeration, but you get my point) 

I was wondering if anyone knows of any kind of custom boot manufacturers that would be able to make a boot with a small footbed, but that also offers the proper lower leg support that I need. I've been skiing all my life so I've learned to cope with it, but I really struggle in powder to keep my weight centred when I've got almost nothing to brace against.

First ski season and buying ski's,"Hi guys and girls,


I have just secured a job in whistler and will be heading out late October I have a few questions to ask and I literally don't know where else to ask. 

I have skiied a bit before and would say I'm an intermidiate skiier, can link turns, get down red and black runs, not tried any off piste but would be interested. 

I am from the U.K and ski shops are practically non existant and I have read online that you need to buy ski boots in person and have them professionally fitted, also with traveling to Canada I would like to travel as light as reasonably possible. (I know this is going to be difficult as I plan on staying for at least 2 years) 

Would I be better off just buying skis, boots etc in Canada? I also get staff discount (around 20%) or  going to a U.K ski shop and take it out with me? 

Also should I buy stiffer more advance skis because I intend on skiing a lot and imagine I will progress. Would I be held back by buying intermediate skis or should I buy advance ski and ""grow into them""?

I took a lot longer then anyone else to be persuaded to go down the run, and even now months later I'm having nightmares about it.

Help with new skis,"I have been snowboarding for 7 years and finally decided to make the switch to skiing. 

I really enjoys glades and backcountry. Yes even on a board. 

I live in michigan where we have pretty small hills so I'm not to worried about speed, enjoys the parks more out here anyways, and I go mostly when we get good amounts of snow or take trips to places with more powder. 

I preferred a shorter board than suggested and definetly prefer symmetrical flex and stance so I'm thinking the same for skis. 

5'9"" and 130 lbs with a $1500 ish budget.

"Fast on-piste skiing, quite village, good food and views","Hi, 

My wife and I are looking for skiing destination in the Alps for mid-January next year. We are looking at: 

* Three Valleys
* Zermatt
* St Moritz
* Val-d'Isère.

&amp;#x200B;

What is very important for us:

* Good food
* Fast on-piste skiing. We are advanced skiers and love fast red and black tracks. Not the most steep though as one needs to restrain the speed on them.
* Awesome scenery. Nothing like lying on the snow enjoying the view.
* Quiet and not overcrowded place. We prefer more secluded and authentic villages. **We don't go party when skiing**.

We also enjoyed doing the Sella Ronda in The Dolomites, so it would be nice if the area is connected and we could travel a lot just by lifts. This is not a must though as we would do it only for a day. If there is good variety of slopes, it will do.

  
We want to try a new place, so we will exclude:

* The Dolomites
* Ski Welt
* Chamonix (the whole area, including Verbier and Courmayeur)

Can someone give more insight in to the ones we are hesitating between. Some questions I couldn't find answers to are:

1. How easy it is to get between areas in Three Valleys? I saw Saint Martin being recommended as a quiet village, but it also have only one lift connected to the pistes, which usually means huge crowds in the morning. Is this the case?
2. Having in mind the other areas are smaller, are they getting more crowded?",skiing,1566151657,kristark,True,2019-08-18,1

Where to ski at the end of February?,"My girlfriend and I are looking for suggestions on where to go for a week-long ski trip at the end of February. We have been to Whistler a couple times recently and also to Telluride. We love Whistler and Telluride, but we are looking to try somewhere new. 

Ability-wise we are strong intermediates. We had no issues skiing any blues at Whistler and some easier Whistler blacks. We still don't quite have the hang of off piste skiing or large moguls, but we are trying to learn. We ski in the mid-atlantic and we are fine with any mid-atlantic trails. We typically like to take a lesson or two on ski trips. 

We are mainly looking for a lot of terrain within our ability level (will probably be skiing for 5-6 days), places with a good amount of ski-in-ski-out lodging options and ease of travel would be a plus. Places with easy gladed trails would be a plus (like the Symphony or 7th Heaven areas at Whistler or Enchanted Forest at Telluride). I was thinking Big Sky, Vail or Park City. I want to go to Jackson, but I don't think we are good enough at skiing to get the most out of it. Nightlife isn't a big concern since we typically ski from first lift until last then fall asleep.

Looking for a ski that I won’t outgrow in a year.,"So I’m a snowboard instructor, and this season I’ll be spending a lot of my free time on the sticks instead of the tray so I can sit my ski instructor certification at the end of it.

I’ve been on skis before.

Once.

When I was 8.

I’m now 29.

So suffice it to say I’m a complete beginner, but I learn fast and obviously have experience on snow in other disciplines.

So I’m looking for a ski that I can keep in my quiver past the initial learning curve. Something I can teach on and have some good fun on and grow into as well. Maybe around 100mm waist width with rockered tip and tail. Something wide enough that I can have a slash around in some powder, but still has decent edge hold and edge to edge transition, but still forgiving enough while I’m finding my feet again after 2 decades.

[Help] Visiting the Alps,"Hello everyone.

We are a team of 4 that love snowboarding. We are from Greece and we are willing to travel to the Alps and stay for a week to snowboard. We are looking for the best overall experience the Alps can offer but we want to avoid extremely pricey resorts.

First of all we would like to snowboard in December but im not quite sure if the snow will be good at this time around. It is possible for resorts to have good quality snow in that time of the year or should we visit January/February?

We have been snowboarding for 2-7 years so, we are not really into Black pistes. We are mostly Freeriders but we enjoy parks. We also want the resort to have great view (we do not have that in our Greek resorts:( ), and if the village of the resort that we ll stay is nice that will be a plus.

&amp;#x200B;

Please share any experience you have if you have visited ski resorts in the Alps. I have done a very brief research and have written down the following resorts. I need to research them more but if you know that some of them are super good/super bad it would be good to know. Sites ranking resorts are not as good as hearing opinions first hand.

New Skis for New England Slopes,"Hi all, I'm moving to New England for uni and I'm also looking at owning a pair of skis for the first time since \~2012 (I've been growing so it made more sense to rent). 

I'd describe myself as an advanced skier; I can do all marked trails like double blacks, I like to go in the trees a lot, and I also love powder. I haven't skied the past two years to prepare for uni so I've never really done any hardcore backcountry skiing but I'll really love to start this winter. 

However, I suppose there isn't that much powder in New England to do this and to justify a wider ski, but I'm also making trips to Niseko, Japan in December and Whistler, B.C. in March. Looking at the Black Crows line up, for example, the Atris (108) would be great for Niseko and Whistler but probably would be bad for the day-to-day skiing in New England. The opposite could be said for skis like the Captis or Camox. I'd obviously also like a ski that I'd be able to use for years as my skiing develops. Any suggestions?

Personally I’m a single planker, so please don’t hold that against me!

I’ve got my brother and family coming to BC for a ski trip over Christmas. (I already live here in Vancouver)

He currently does not own any gear (living in Australia with one ski trip a year doesn’t justify owning it)

He would be an upper intermediate skill level.

The plan is for me to keep an eye out for some used Skis and Bindings around me in the ramp up to peak season, and the day he lands we will head to one of the many local ski shops in Vancouver to pick up some new boots. Everything here is much more reasonably priced and more readily available (He will then take them home)

He’s 65kg, around 5’8”.
Probably aim for an All-Mountain ski (is that what they are called?) not specifically for groomers, but not a full powder ski- because let’s face it, back in Aus they will never see the light of day..

Were intended on skiing Cypress and Whistler, maybe a trip to Revelstoke.
(Again, something that will actually be enjoyable in the powder here, but not completely useless on the icy groomers in Aus)

Anyone able to offer some advice on what exactly I should be looking for with used equipment?

Doing my first season this winter...what do I need to know?,"Hey!

So 23/m, doing my first season in Whistler. I’ve got a job lined up (9-5 office position - happy with that, I know its not typical but it suits me), housing in progress (staff housing), so those are the big things. 

But as I’ve never done a season before I’m wondering what I need to know, do’s, don’ts etc both generally and specific to whistler.

I’m an expert skier/former national racer. I’m not particularly interested in backcountry/off piste skiing, I mostly just ride groomers for days and mess about a bit in the park. 

To kick start, I’ve got a few questions:

* I’ve not owned a pair of all-mountain skis for over a decade; my current skis are all slalom/GS skis and as much as I love them, I doubt I’ll be racing much. What skis should I be looking at? (I’m 172cm, 60kg, but as I said, expert skier. My racing skis are 155, 165, and 185). Or should I just rent/demo for a bit and find some I like while I’m there?
* What stuff should I be bringing over? I’m from the UK, so obviously have limited luggage space. I’ll bring my boots, but helmet? Poles?
* I know I need $2,000 CA minimum available as part of my visa but how much do I need for “setting up costs”? 
* What are those setting up costs? (I’m thinking Canadian SIM card, skis...not sure what else?)

What is your 'Leg Blaster' routine for pre-season?,"A little note to give an idea of my physical fitness currently,
I was regularly running on average of 5-8 miles a day 5 times a week (ran up to a half marathon) for the last 6 months on top of 45-90 minutes of weight lifting 4 days on 1 day off with a 45-90 minute ab work on those 1 day off - I'd take an extra day off whenever I felt my muscles needed it (varying routine sets as I changed them every month or so with the most recent being mainly compound and core exercises like clean and presses, deadlifts, squats, etc.).  This past 40 though I've went easy on the weight lifting, have done a lot of pull-ups, dips, push-up with the following leg blaster exercise set

starting off I would do
10 Jump burpees
20 Lateral Lunges
50 Lateral hop
10 Air squats
10 forward alternating lunges
10 Jump squats
10 Jump lunges

x5 then progress up to x10 to x20 over two 1 week periods doing this 4-5x a week with a few days to fully recover after the week period.

I then changed it to
20 Jump burpees
40 Lateral Lunges
50 Lateral hop
20 Air squats
20 forward alternating lunges
20 Jump squats
20 Jump lunges

x5 then progress up to x10 and I could sometimes go x15 (once I got up to x20 though with longer breaks between sets and minor gaps in between some exercises like the burpees).  If I'm struggling I will sometimes skip a round of the jump burpees as they are what really drain you, but continue with everything else then add it back in.  During the breaks between sets I'd often do a few pull ups with various grips as it didn't add to the fatigue.

I noticed with the jump lunges I would once in a while my joints in my toes and my knees would start to wear, so I'd subtract them if need be.

I was in a situation during this past 8 months where I had 2-4 hours a day I could devote to working out.  I was 145 having lost 80 lbs in a very unhealthy manner, and then worked my way up from no muscle doing 25 push ups a day with 25 burpees and some other random work outs to 195 lbs ~7 months later with running + weightlifting to 182lbs after a final 40 days of a minor diet and doing the 'super' leg blaster set.  I'm now back in a situation where I don't have as much time to basically devote all my time and energy to getting in shape, but I plan doing 2x heavier leg blaster routine + 2x 6 mile runs + 1 to 2x compound weight exercise every 8 days until ski season to maintain my level of fitness.

Need some help deciding ski length,"TL;DR: planning to buy Nordica Enforcer 100, but worried that 177 cm might be too long/too much ski for me. Torn between 177 and 169 cm. Please advise. 


Hi all, I’m looking to buy a pair of Nordica Enforcer 100s, but am really torn between which length to get. This will be my third pair of skis. I have a pair of Rossignol Pursuit 800 ti at 170 cm, and a pair of Volkl RTM 84 at 167 cm.   The Enforcers come in at 169 and 177cm. 

I’m 5-10, 175, advanced skier, in pretty good shape, but I’m also 50,  177 would be the longest ski I have skied, and at 100 mm underfoot, the enforcer will also be the widest. I feel really comfortable with my RTMs, which have front/tail rocker, but I believe less rocker than the Enforcers. I know that rocker reduces length , but still feel like the 177 might be too long for me (even though all the websites tell me they’re not). 

I like responsive and snappy skis that feel playful and responsive. For reference, I skied the Blizzard Bonafide a few years ago (173 cm 98 mm underfoot) and didn’t like them because they felt like 2x4s.  To be fair, I’m a better skier now than I was then, I was transitioning from a narrow intermediate level ski when I tried them.

Lastly, East coast skier here, but take a trip out west every year or so. Hitting up Jackson Hole this winter. Not sure I want to deal with renting while I’m out there, so looking to beef up my quiver.

First time skiing! I LOVE IT!,"I just recently got back from a 6-day school camp in the Snowy Mountains in Australia. And all I can say is, I think i have fallen in love with skiing! 

I love living in Australia, but one unfortunate symptom of this is that it only snows in a few small scattered areas. Because of this, in my nearly 17 years of life I had never seen snow until last Monday. 

Each day we received 2 hour lessons in big groups before we were allowed free time. My teacher was absolutely outstanding but i found that I progressed much faster than others. By the third day I had started to try and keep my skis as parallel as possible as opposed to snowploughing down the whole slope like the rest of my group. Other friends who grew up skiing even noticed that i was progressing quite well. 

Even though I had one quite bad stack (that's what i deserve for getting to cocky!)  I began to feel increasingly confident. I planned to approach my teacher to get some extra help with parallel skiing as I noticed that whilst my skis were parallel, they were often a little further apart then other people that I saw flying down the runs. Unfortunately due to time constraints this was not possible, hence, i turned to the internet in order to work out how to fix my skiing in the last two days. This was only met with confusion as the information was hard for me to understand. 

Anyway, I made sure to work on what I was doing and to enjoy that last of my time on the slopes. 

The post-skiing depression didn't really hit until we arrived back in Sydney at 11pm last night. I enjoyed skiing so much and I want to go back so bad!

Any tips on improving my skills (particularly with parallel skiing) would be gladly appreciated. 

I hope to return to the slopes in the near future.",skiing,1564835924,nick882,True,2019-08-03,1
"Does anyone here have experience skiing after a meniscus surgery? Also, workout tips?","So, I unfortunately tore my meniscus at work(medial bucket handle).  Currently I'm at the five-and-a-half week mark post-surgery, and my PT says things are going well.  Six weeks is officially when I can start bearing weight again.

Obviously, I'm going to do whatever the doctor and PT say.  The PT says that I will likely be well enough to ski this season, but ""if I'm doing double-blacks and moguls, it probably won't feel great.""

So I'm just wondering if anyone in this sub has had any experience with this situation.  Again, I'm going to do what the medical professionals say, so I'm not looking for medical advice per se, just curious about other people's experiences.

That being said, I am definitely looking for workout tips to strengthen my knee(s) for skiing.

"How to check if you're long oval, interment oval, or round oval for helmet buying purposes","This are the 3 types of head shape that helmet manufacturers use as reference:
https://outdoorgearlab-mvnab3pwrvp3t0.stackpathdns.com/photos/11/83/239779_10570_L.jpg

All this information can be found here by the way:
https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/topics/snow-sports/best-ski-helmet/buying-advice

The advise from above website to check your head shape is: ""to ascertain your head shape, have a friend check out your head from above"".

But what to do if you have no friend?

Luckily, the folks at ""The Fedora Lounge"" (of course) know just how to acertain your head shape, scientifically, by yourself, without a friend:
https://www.thefedoralounge.com/threads/measuring-for-long-oval.51741/

Basically, you take a giant caliper and measure the length of your head from forehead to the protruding bone skull at the back of your head and the width from the points just above your ears.

Now, subtract the length with the width, and the difference is what will determine your head shape:

Round oval is 5/8 inch longer than it is wide 

Regular oval is 1 3/8 inches longer than it is wide 

Long oval is 2 1/8 inches longer than it is wide 

X-Long oval is 2 7/8 inches longer than it is wide 

XX-Long oval is 3 5/8 inches longer than it is wide

Beginners to skiing advice needed,"Hello so this winter my friends and I are joining another family to ski at Whistler Blackcomb this winter.

Seeking guests for podcast about life after being a competitive athlete,"Hey r/skiing!

I'm producing a podcast about the transition from being a competitive athlete to everything after. The podcast, called ""Run Along"", was created with the hope of opening up the depth and breadth of this conversation. We’re going from the surface-level topics -- e.g. what to do with all your random participation trophies and how to not be the aggressive slide tackler in the over 30 league -- to the bottom of the ocean convos -- think loss of identity and a skewed sense of self-worth. The hope is to also gather as many kinds of stories as possible. Olympians, high school ballers, super-fan parents, and athletes who dealt with injury, congenital defects and everything in between.

Sooo, I was wondering if any former competitive skiers here would be interested in coming on the pod? Would also love to hear what people are doing as real life adults with careers and maybe how being a competitive skier imbued with you traits/attitudes that have helped you succeed now -- whether that be as employees, partners, etc!

Ski Recommendation - Ice Coast,"Hey r/skiing \- I'm in the market for a new pair of skis, and I was hoping you could help me in my search.

Already in my quiver is a set of 98mm underfoot Blizzard Bonafides. I really like them when I go out west and for powder days on the East Coast, but they are, in my opinion, too much ski for the majority of East Coast days. 

I'm an advanced skier. These skis will be use primarily for days of skiing hardpack/icy moguls, glades, &amp; groomers. I'd say 40/60 on/off-piste. They need to have a short turning radius for moguls/glades and they need to be able to grip &amp; rip an icy groomer.

I've been looking in the 78-84mm waist width range, with a skew towards the low end, as I can break out my Bonafides if I need to go fat. Bonus points if they're twin tips or at least have rounded backs (seems hard to find in this width range, but I do like to ski backwards &amp; generally fuck around) &amp; if they're sexy (yes performance comes first, that's why this is a BONUS point).

I've looked at the Nordica Navigator 80mm &amp; Soul Rider 84mm. The Navigator is perfect except the lack of twins &amp; the Soul Rider could be just a bit narrower for me.

Forgiving All Mountain I can push when I want," I am 50 and started skiing when I was 12. In the late 90s I started snow boarding a little and I ended up taking a ride in the sled, then a few years of PT. This, and money, kept me off the slopes until my son began skiing through his school, 4 years ago. I have been skiing on Fisher Pro MTN Fires(165), short for my 6' height, but they allowed me to get back up to speed quickly and , always with confidence. I even ventured off trail, and skied  an east coast blizzard   with them, but it is time for the next level ski. Though I want a ski that is easy on me, so I can ski all day, I also want to be able to push when I want. At present my skis force me to slow down after connecting a string of carves or just plain blasting. I am leaning toward the navigator due to the reviews that fit the bill for this east coast easy going experienced intermediate , but am starting to wonder if the Fischer FR 90 might not also be something to consider, seeing how I am attracted to messing around a little off trail, and the twin tip might be a little more forgiving when I find myself on a crowded slope and skidding around those obstacles . I have never skied on twin tips but starting to understand the advantage.  All That being said I am primarily on groomers . I ski the greens and blues. Thanks in advance for any suggestion.",skiing,1563875867,ClemsonJohnson,True,2019-07-23,1

Question about getting a refund* for the IKON pass.,"So I'm aware that they don't do refunds for the IKON pass, not even if the season hasn't started yet (which is totally lame even if I understand why they do it). However looking into it a bit more, it seems like you can purchase insurance on your pass, and then be reimbursed for the price of it under some specific circumstances.

There is a chance that I will have an opportunity to be in Europe for the entire ski season for a sort of job, but one that pays a stipend rather than a wage (AKA I won't need a work visa, just a student visa). I'm just curious if anyone here has gone through the process of getting this insurance and being reimbursed.

2020 ski season - Epic pass - resort recommendations?,"Hi everyone,

I learned to ski for the first time this year and got 12 days over the following resorts:

* Boyne Mountain, Michigan (2 days)
* Winter Park (3 days)
* Copper Mountain (1 day)
* Park City (2 days)
* Alta (1 day)
* Solitude (1 day)
* Snowbasin (1 day)
* Deer Valley (1 day)

&amp;#x200B;

For 2020, I signed up for a full Epic Pass. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I am based in Dallas, I have to fly in, which makes it a bit trickier than if I lived in CO or Utah.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the following places I was thinking of hitting up for Jan - March 2020:

* Vail
* Breckenridge
* Whistler
* Telluride
* Sun Valley
* Heavenly
* Park City (got a deal on a ski-in resort here for $350 total for 4 nights, 3 days as long as I sit through a 2-hour timeshare presentation lol)
* Crested Butte maybe
* possibly something in Japan

&amp;#x200B;

Is this feasible to pull off between January and March? Would any of these open even in December perhaps and have decent snow?

I have a lot of flexibility to fly out Thursday nights, fly back to Dallas Monday - type trips. That's how I did both the Utah trips earlier this year - however, in a 3 day weekend in Utah, you could hit different resorts on each day since everything is within a 1 hour drive of SLC. Colorado....not so much since it's not centralized.

Telluride and Sun Valley are both restricted to 7 days total - is it worth trying to hit a whole 7 days at each one or will I get bored? The longest I've spent at the previous resorts was the 3 days at Winter Park (not 3 straight, but 3 over a week), and I wonder if sticking to one place for 7 days is overkill.

&amp;#x200B;

The ones I've got on the list, are they overall the best ones that I **have** to hit up? My reasoning for the ones I chose....

Vail &amp; Breck - since they seem to be the most famous ones

Whistler - famous again

Telluride - heard great things + limited on Epic Pass

Sun Valley - same as Telluride

Heavenly - looks gorgeous being able to see Lake Tahoe

Park City - have to go since I've got the ski-in hotel lol

Crested Butte - heard good things

Japan - cause I'm feeling overambitious and will likely axe it from the list lol

A recipe for European disaster?,"What are the odds this blows up in my face? (Advice and constructive criticism welcomed)

Going to Lyon/Geneva the last week of November with my wife and 9 y/o son. Got the wife, who does not ski, to agree to a 2-3 trip to the Alps so the boy and I can ski. 

I’ve never been skiing outside of NC and Snoeshoe in WV. Skiing in NC is more ice-skiing than snow-skiing, but I can hold my own. The boy has been a quick learner.  But going from this crap in NC to the freakin’ Alps seems a bit of a leap for me, but you only live once, right?

The wife will need to entertain herself while we are trying to ski, so I am looking for a quaint village with good skiing nearby. Zermatt seems to be a good fit for us, but I would love some ideas for other places non-skiers enjoy. 

So, here are my concerns:

1. The weather/conditions in late November
2. The wife being bored
3. Only spending 2-3 days instead of a week
4. Probably just skiing on piste (is it on piste of just piste?), still worth going? 
5. #4 reminded me that I only speak English, and not very well, so I should add “Learning curve for skiing out of the States” to this list. 
6. What gear should I take? I’m leaning towards my boots. 

Maybe I should cross post with r/roastme because I feel like I might end up spending more time and money than it is worth.

Seems Meribel is nice because it’s central, Val Thorens is supposed to be ugly but with the best snow due to altitude, and Courchevel probably closest to Zermatt in terms of quality of accommodations, food, etc.

Question on upgrading boots?,"This has been my first season skiing and I fell in love with it.

Second ski for the quiver? Currently riding a 184 atris.,"I am debating whether I want to pick up a second ski to bring out west with me this year. In prior years, ive flown out from the east coast so this wasn't feasible. This year I am going to be living in a camper of sorts for a few months, so I can easily keep a second set up top. 

I'm an advanced skier that prefers more off-piste type conditions. Love a powder day when I can get them. I skied 45 days last year; aiming for 60 this year. Have an ikon pass and will be skiing Utah, WY, CA, and PNW. Still ironing out the logistics, but there will be some degree of powder chasing.

Currently riding a set of black crow atris 184, (108 under foot).  To the extent I am going to buy something, it will be second hand on ebay. I hear you demo demo demo, but at the end of the day im too cheap for that. Id rather roll the dice on a used pair off ebay; if I dont like them I can resell. 

Part of me wants to get a set of dedicated powder skis - the bent chetler 120s are sooooo pretty...  Happy to hear why im wrong.",skiing,1563539328,vividfotojournalist2,True,2019-07-19,1

Bigfoot,"Good day all, I’m getting back into skiing after a few years away from the sport and am looking for some advice on boots.

About me, I’m 6’6”, weigh 280 pounds and would classify myself as an aggressive heavy advanced/expert skier.  I’ll be mostly sticking to the frontside in the northeast US.

My main issue is that I have both a wide foot (116 fore foot) and a long foot (320 mm).  I know I’m not getting anything even close to those specs off the shelf, but have never really felt the need to go custom.  When I last owned boots they were 32.5 sized with a 103 last and I felt fine at the end of a day of runs.

My current dilemma is that I’m only really seeing four options available to me online that would come close to my needs:

1. 2019 Nordica Sportmachine 120 (size 32.5, 102 last)
2. 2018 Rossignol Alias 120 (size 32.5, 104 last)
3. 2017/2018/2019 Salomon X-Pro 100 (size 32.5, 100+ last)
4. 2018 Head Advant Edge 125 (size 32.5, 102 last)

I know the conventional wisdom is go to a boot fitter and try what you want on, well unfortunately that isn’t an option for me as literally no one carries size 32.5 wide in stock.  So I’m hoping that anyone here may have some insight on any of the above options or may have an idea of something else I haven’t been able to find.

Best High End North American Resort?,"Folks,

Whistler? And if you have one in mind, please elaborate a bit as to why. From what I understand, Beaver is comparable to Aspen, but with less ski acreage and a less interesting town.

"It's going to be a la Nina year, plan accordingly.","Hey everyone,

I've been chasing storms on the west coast since the el Nino of 97/98 in terms of skiing.  I retired from skiing and moved to the beach in a tropical area because skiing is lame unless you can be strapped, and California hasn't been stoked on my idea of bringing the biathlon to the Sierras with a more alpine focus, which is a shame because there's nothing like putting an iron site on some snowboarder trying to hand plant the side of a jump, but that's besides the point.  

Last summer I predicted this el Nino year based on the water temps I was seeing and I'm predicting a following la Nina year.  It means a colder and drier year for most of the west coast, it's not going to be anything like last year, it'll be drier than average, and considering global warming and shit, averages are increasing/lowering all over the place so plan for an extreme swing in snowfall.  

If you are planning trips far out I would look at la Nina maps of snowfall from previous events and condense the snowfall areas.  

La Nina in California and southwest can mean some resorts/areas don't even open. 

We will see how many downvotes this gets, but the overall message is **just be extra cautious about planning trips this season in areas affected by la Nina**.  As much as I love telling you tourons to only ski switch with equal pressure and shoulders and arms parallel with the fall line while on your ON3Ps clipped to FKS 14s with unbuckled Full Tilts I figured I'd let you know what kind of temperatures I am seeing and what I think that means.  

Disclaimer:  I am a professional level scientist (I have a bunch of letters after my name) and this is a qualitative analysis of a field outside my own in direct study, though correlation with my research and alpine conditions were relevant and I do have [quantitative data](https://imgur.com/bigRivK) from several years in the cascades, though I'm not talking about those years.  

TLDR; I am literally in the Pacific Ocean every day and I keep track of the temperature and have been following this shit for a long time, so break out your rock skis because it's going to be a shitty winter as far as snowfall and the west coast is concerned.  That doesn't mean there won't be powder days, but if you are planning anything look at la Nina maps and decide from there.",skiing,1563687144,Thebraintickler,True,2019-07-21,1

I got to go skiing this spring in the Austrian alps and got completely hooked. Here's the problem: I'm college student in Texas,"I spent the past 7 months living in Austria and I was able to go skiing for the first time this March in Radstatt, which I was able to swing for about $400 US total for 3 days of skiing.

After a couple lessons I managed to make it down the whole mountain (Very Slowly) and the next day I was able to do several consecutive runs! I even made it through the slalom course a few times.

Problem is, I live in DFW and I'm a college student,  so $400 is a pretty major purchase for me,  and I've heard that US slope passes are significantly more expensive than the ~$50US/Day I paid.

Fairly newer to skiing and fell in love with it immediately, tried my hand first with snowboarding and couldn’t make it cleanly down a bunny hill for 2 days.

I plan on going a lot more this year possibly getting a season pass and really wouldn’t like to get rentals everytime, but really don’t know what I need. I will solely be skiing on the east coast PA/NY primarily. I guess I’d describe myself as intermediate I really only go down blues and single diamond blacks with the exception of a few double blacks. I really enjoy going down glades and testing myself with some jumps nothing too crazy. Wouldn’t really describe myself as that aggressive of a skier, don’t usually go for speed on slopes more cutting and turning. I’m 21 years old 6’ 3” and about 150-155lbs.  Although I’ve picked up the skiing part I really have little knowledge on the actual equipment as to what size, how much camber and just type of skis in general I need. From what I’ve read All Mountain skis might seem to be the best fit? But again that’s just me trying my best guess. 

I realize being newer some people may think it’s not worth it to immediately buy my own but with how much I hope and plan on going I’d really like to save the money I’d spend on rentals.

- Is it recommended to buy bindings online or wait until I go to a ski shop this winter in CO. I don’t plan on applying them myself.
- I know that boots are the most important part when shopping, and I will have to get a boot shaped to my foot because I have a bunion from my basketball shoes over time.

Looks like that place doesn’t start catching solid snow until January and February as does most other places over here on the east side of the US. 

Our two main priorities in finding a place is high potential for fresh powder (we skies Snowshoe, WV in December last year and it was 100% ice). The other is keeping it relatively inexpensive. We’re young professionals out of ATL just trying to catch an adrenaline high and see what snow looks like. Not fine dine every night and spend lots of money.

Searching for an old Armada Ski Jacket from 2013!,"Hi everyone, I’m just posting in this subreddit because I’ve destroyed my favourite jacket and I’m searching for a replacement hoping that since I have multiple jackets maybe someone has this one hiding at the back of their gear cupboard. I think we can all admit we have a favourite skiing jacket and this was mine. 

Went up the mountain last weekend and when I took the chains off of my car, someone had dumped petrol or diesel all over the chain bay which destroyed the road (terrible for the environment as well and I don’t think that there’s any excuse to dump fuel in a national park). The smell was overwhelming but I thought I’d be okay because I have a mat I lay on when I remove my chains.  When I got down on the ground to remove my chains I managed to roll around in the melted asphalt and ruin my boots and jacket which I hadn’t taken off for the drive home. Trying to air the smell out of my car mats has been a nightmare and I’ve had to wash everything that touched the ground when I took the chains off.  

My shoes are a write off which I can accept, and the light blue sections on my jacket are stained with asphalt specks. I’ve been cleaning it knowing that I can reactivate the Goretex in the jacket afterwards but the marks just won’t budge from the light blue areas. 

Happy to pay and pay shipping for your troubles. I’m autistic and emotionally attached to this jacket. I wore it for my first season ski instructing and I can’t find anything in the same colourway on the shelves anymore. 

Here’s a link to photos of the jacket 
http://imgur.com/a/WUU4FCR

I have the Armada men’s Couloir in medium but I’d also be happy to find the women’s Kenzie in medium

Buying new gear - I’ve got questions!,"I’m in the PNW and ski Crystal Mountain, Tahoe and a trip to the Rockies each year. I’m buying all new gear now that it’s summer and everything is clearing out for new inventory. 

I am new, but ski all the blacks and was venturing into double blacks and bowls at the end of last season. I did that on some on Salomon 85 boots and 172 waist 165cm skis. I enjoy the trees, bumps, deeper snow, and get a little scared going fast on hard groomers. 

I’m looking at a 110-120 stiffness boot and either the Nordica Enforcer 100 in 185cm or the Salomon QST 106 in 188cm. 

Am I way off on boot stiffness? The Atomic Ultra Hawx the best fit for my foot. What about skis? Are there any other skis I should consider? I demoed the QST 99 in 181cm last year and had fun, but they just weren’t for me. I did like how agile they were for a ski that is much larger than what I’m used to. I’m 6’1” and 185lbs.

One-in-Quiver Kanjo 2019 vs Brahma CA 2018 vs Head Kore 2019,"Hi Guys,  
I am looking for a one-in-quiver type of ski and hope you can help me choose. I am 5’11” (180 cm) and 190-195 lbs (86-89 kg) advanced intermediate. I ski like 75 on-piste and 25 off-piste. I like to go really fast sometimes, usually medium turns. I tried some two metal sheets skis in the past (like Mantra), which I found fun and high performance but definitely tiring. I want to try something lighter, less demanding and more playful to actually enjoy skiing for the whole day. I have narrowed my choices down to 3 skis:  
\- Volkl Kanjo 2018/2019 (\~240 USD \[75-100 of the metal edge is still in place\] lightly used, prepared fully for a season)  
\- Blizzard Brahma CA 2017/2018 (\~250 USD new without bindings)  
\- Head Kore 93 2018/2019 (\~ 460 USD new with bindings)

  
What would you call the main differences in the feel in between these three?  
What kind of bindings would you suggest for Brahma if I would go with them?

What size should I take? 

Kanjo 175 vs 182 cm

Brahma CA 173 vs 180 vs 187 cm

4 Days West or 6 Days East?,"I'm planning on taking a solo trip this winter and I'm having a hard time deciding if I want to do 4 days at Big Sky or 6 days in Vermont. If I go out west I'll be flying and will have to rely on public transit (I think there's a bus from Bozeman?). If I head over to VT I'd be able to drive to different resorts and spend an extra couple days skiing. If I went with VT I'd go Smuggs (I go at least once a year), Bolton, and MRG for the first 3 days and I was thinking a day up at Sutton and 2 at Jay for the last 3.

About Me: I'd say I'm a pretty competent skier. I mostly ski blacks, steep blues, and the occasional double black. I love to ski trees &amp; glades and dip into the features on the edges of the trails. I'm certainly not against hiking for my lines either; I did plenty of that last time I was out west at PowMow. 

As much as I'd love to take a trip out West again, it would ultimately be more expensive, fewer days, and definitely more stressful (the traveling bits at least). On the other hand I've been to VT many times and although I'd be going to 3 new mountains it'd still just be East coast skiing. 

So what do the fine folks of r/skiing think? A quality trip that's going to stress me out and cost more money? Or a quantity trip that's going to be more varied and easy-going?",skiing,1562879367,Bebe_Rexxar,True,2019-07-11,1
Patagonia Shell Jacket Choices,"Backstory: I moved to the mountains almost two years ago and bought a Patagonia Descentionist pant and a Mountain Hardware shell. I was on the mountain 120 days in the two seasons and ravaged both pieces. I took the pants into my local Patagonia shop sporting giant gouges/tears from trees (repaired with tenacious tape), zipper issues, and some delam. They took them in, decided they couldn't repair it, and gave me full value credit (and i bought them on sale for half off at $160 to begin with). Blown away by this service and after reading more about the company I'm a convert to their ethos. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 5'9"" 155lbs with an athletic build (wide shoulders/chest and small waist 31""). Now the problem is that ArcTeryx really do fit the best of any outerwear I've tried, but my experience with their warranty is subpar. My favorite piece of clothing EVER, the ArcTeryx Atom LT jacket, got a little tear in the sleeve and they wouldn't do anything in regards to their ""lifetime warranty"" so they are out for me. If you wanted to know, they told me it's made to be a midlayer and not an outer layer so a snag from a bush isn't their problem.  


So back to Patagonia. I took my $380 ""refund"" and bought an excellent condition size 31"" PowSlayer pant from Patagonia Worn Wear for 1/3 their MSRP and have about $150 still to spend with them. The pants are a little long (I'm a 30"" inseam), but with the boots they will be fine. Now I'm looking at upgrading my beat up Mountain Hardware shell jacket. I haven't been able to find many of the Patagonia shells to try on as it is summer here, but want to snag one when it pops up on Worn Wear (or craigslist).

&amp;#x200B;

My question is if anyone has experience with the fit of all the Patagonia shells? I was able to try on a small and it was just a tad too tight in the chest/shoulders, but couldn't find a medium to try on. How does the Powder Bowl (or any of the others you've tried) fit in comparison to the PowSlayer jacket?

Cheapo Vanlife while Skiing,"I'm 26 and living in a city on the east coast. I work at a job that allows me to do significant remote work along with a healthy number of vacation days that I use every winter. Last year I just flew out out west attempting to chase powder a bunch, along with 2 weeks in japan. 

I got 45 days in, which was great, but I spent wayyyy too much on rental cars and airbnbs ($6k+). I am fortunate enough that I could afford to do so, but I am looking to try to spend way less and ski more this year. 

I do not own a car right now, but I am debating purchasing a used Minivan/SUV, and ripping out the back two rows to convert it into a camper of sorts. I'm pretty low maintenance, def don't need anything fancy. I am content eating fruit, nuts, and protein shakes with the occasional take out. 

I imagine that I will mix a few days of airbnbs in with the car here and there to do laundry, and to take a break from it. The plan would be to spend 2-3 weeks at a time out west, coming back home in between. Goal is 60+ ski days.

Curious if anyone has done this before, and the lessons/challenges learned. I've read quite a bit about people who live in a van full time, but not those that are using it like this (i.e. as a cheap mobile ski home). In anticipation of the suggestion, I have considered moving out west, but for a variety of reasons it isn't practical for this upcoming season at least.

FYI I have Ikon for this upcoming season.  I wake up everyday wanting to ski and being sad that I cant. The resources ive been using so far are below.

Buying (renting?) skis for Japan trip,"Background: 

* Planning a trip to Japan to ski Niseko/Rusutsu in early January and I don't own any skis worth flying over with
* I want to either **buy** a pair (no bigger than 110mm b/c I'm in the northeast US with no plans to move anytime soon so I want something I could use back home) or **rent** a pair (no width limit since I'm just gonna return em anyway)

I have minimal pow skiing experience so I don't know what kind of pow skis would be good for the trip. I've skied on 106mm skis a total of 6 days and skied in proper powder maybe 2 days. I'm 5'7 (170cm) and 135lb (61kg). I can ski nearly anywhere on the mountain as long as it doesn't look like a FWT route.

* What width should I be looking for? I've read that anything under 110mm is too small for Japan, but would I be able to control wider planks if I haven't skied anything like that?
* What height should I be looking for? Should 180cm be my max? Once again I'm worried about being able to control such a big ski. Biggest ski I've been on is 180cm for a day - It wasn't too difficult.
* I've heard twin tip is best since they're easier to turn on. Thoughts?
* I'm torn on buying vs. renting. Is renting around Niseko easy or will it just end up being a hassle? Should I just ball out and buy a pair even if they'll sit in my room until I get another rare chance to ski powder?",skiing,1562442389,JayCon098,True,2019-07-06,1

Black Crows Anima Sizing,"Hey guys, would really appreciate some advice here. I'm dead set on buying the Black Crows Anima for my dedicated powder ski.

Needing some advice for a big European Ski Trip,"Hi everyone, long time observer first time poster

&amp;#x200B;

I am an intermediate level skiier from New Zealand in my early 20's; looking to head over to Europe for New Years, thought that while i'm there making my mind up about a permanent move to the UK that I would pop on over and dabble in some winter season shredding throughout January in the Alps which is something i've always dreamed of being able to do.

The plan I had in mind was 2 weeks in France (1 at Courchevel and 1 at Chamonix), 1 week in Switzerland at Zermatt and then having a bit of a break before heading to Austria for another week. 

&amp;#x200B;

Really needing some experience or advice as this in uncharted territory for me and have so many different things to consider, my main questions were;  
\- I might have to do some of the trip solo, some friends said they could be keen in coming but am fully prepared for them to bail, so I was interested if there are any super social tours or hostels to stay at that would at least increase my chances of meeting people that I could hit the town or slopes with.  
\- Was just wondering if there was any sort of cost cutting I could do at all to make this any cheaper at all? I know these ski fields can get super expensive (especially Zermatt) which I am prepared for but any saving would be handy

\- Are there any other ski fields/resorts I should look at instead? not to concerned about the difficulty of the slopes as I'll get more experience and confidence as I go through extra lessons etc. but was interested if the overall experience was better elsewhere

&amp;#x200B;

Any other advice is more than welcome too!! cheers!!",skiing,1561678227,kitchenflooper,True,2019-06-27,1

I’m considering getting some Nordica Enforcers  93 waist. My question is two fold.  First, how much difference will the smaller waist on the Nordica make?  Next, considering the smaller waist size on the Nordica, should I go with a length of 177 or 185?

Is it worth it to do the level 1 ski instructor course?,"Hi guys,

Just missed out on the deadline for ski instructor applications down here in Australia. I was hoping to get a position where the level 1 course was paid for by the resort to save me the $1000(AUD) and the other costs associated with going up to the resort for the 3 day course. I didn't get my application in on time, and the way I see it I am stuck between two options:

A) do I spend the $1000 and get my level 1 qualification this season, then apply next year and hope that's enough?

B) do I wait until the same unqualified positions open next year and hedge by bets on getting that position? 

I am very likely to go with option A at this point, but would really love some advice from ex and current ski instructors, especially if you're in Australia! Thanks guys",skiing,1561790530,sjdegroot,True,2019-06-29,1

Advice on new pair of skis?,"Am I allowed to ask for recommendations, even if just general? Hope so.

I've been skiing since I was 11, and I'm now 38. I have a pair of skis that I've loved but I think it's (past) time to retire them. I bought them in 1996, they're Dynastar 3.2 straight sticks. Taller than me and I'm 5'8"" 140lbs (woman).

I get really overwhelmed with all the choices when I look at new skis. I'm East coast USA, small resort and mostly go with my kids but I go often and we will sometimes ski in Vermont or Quebec. I don't imagine I'll get to West coast ski any time soon so powder isn't a huge thing for me. I like to ski fast and do small jumps, quick turns. Not into Moguls or larger jumps. I can ski most trails and glades although I hesitate to say I'm expert. Maybe very advanced intermediate.

And recommendations on where to start? I had thought to stick with Dynastar because I liked my skis, but they don't seem to be very available around here and what I see online seemed limited in choice. It seems like the style now is more of an hour glass shape than straight.

Heater is suspended from the tent's ceiling. Walls and floor of the tent are covered in Mylar or LDPE infrared reflective foil. 

Flame is burning and heating the tent through infrared transparent glass. Thermoelectric elements generate electricity to power the fans which ingest fresh air, and expel  CO2 and CO from the combustion chamber.

 With an average consumption of 50 grams of propane per hour, you are guaranteed a comfortable night however cold it may be! Tell me what you think?

Also, it can dehumidify air in the tent, re-charge your devices overnight and dry your boots and gear.

Advice on deciding between Atomic Hawx Ultra and Full Tilt First Chair boots,"I’ve ordered both pairs of boots with the intention of returning the ones I like less; however, both have arrived and I am having a hard time deciding which ones to keep. The Atomic Hawx Ultra’s are 110’s and the FT’s are 120’s.
I’m an advanced all-mountain skier and I’m wanting a highly versatile, reliable boot.  The Atomic’s feel a bit too narrow right now - I’m assuming they will break in fine though.  The FT’s are much more comfortable but it honestly concerns me a little that they already feel great (i.e., I’m concerned that there will be too much room once they are broken in). 

Any comments on either boots reliability, and how I should expect them to break-in or advice on how I should best compare the two would be greatly appreciated.",skiing,1560887355,yourGodisverydead,True,2019-06-18,1
Can I get your guys thoughts on using an Arc'teryx Alpha SV as a ski jacket?,"Basically i'm in the market for a new jacket

&amp;#x200B;

Basically my option is to buy a ski specific gore-tex jacket like Patagonia Powder Bowl that will keep me nice and snug where I won't really have to worry about layers but can only really use it for skiing.  Or, something like the Alpha SV which is 3 layer GoreTex pro and bomb proof, albeit not nearly as warm but I have the option to add layers underneath when cold, strip them down when warm and can use it for other stuff like hiking, city use etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for something that would with-stand the falls that you take in skiing and obviously something that is going to be fine for tree skiing where I won't really have to worry if I get nicks from branches (like the trees in japan)

&amp;#x200B;

Would the Alpha SV be a a solid choice if I layer up or am I better with something like the powder bowl but pretty limited with what I can do with it? I understand the 3 layer gore-tex pro is seriously tough which is the big appeal to me as opposed to traditional 2 or 2.5 layer goretex

Please share your thoughts on Copper Mountain &amp; Winter Park.,"I had the best time this year using the Ikon Pass to visit resorts I had always dreamed of. Of all the trips (Aspen, Steamboat, Squaw/Alpine, Mammoth, SLC), the resorts in Colorado were standouts. What I especially enjoyed were the long ski runs. Whereas at most ski resorts I am required to frequently sit on lift; at Ajax, Snowmass, and Steamboat, the wonderfully long runs allowed for ample of time on the slope before returning to the chair.

And let’s face it, Colorado is a very cool state. I plan to return next season and maybe visit some different places. Copper Mountain and Winter Park are both on the Ikon Pass. Could you please share your thoughts? 

Specifically: 
1) If you had to choose one resort over the other which would you choose and why? 
2) Are there convenient shuttles and public transportation or should I just plan to rent a car? I will be visiting mid-week and the ski train to WP does only  runs on weekends. I don’t enjoy winter driving but am not completely against it if it makes sense.
3) Where do you recommend staying at each resort? Winter Park seems pretty clear-cut...  at Copper there are some nearby towns (Frisco, Dillon, Silverthorne). Are these good options?

Hestra gloves small fit?,"I ordered size 10 (""XL"") and size 11 (""XXL"")  Hestra Fall Line gloves to test fit, and the 10s feel a little small but I'm worried I'm not judging the fit right because I don't think I have particularly big hands (I'm 5'11"". 20cm from bottom of hand to end of middle finger, which is a 10 based on Hestra's size calculator), so it seems weird that I would need the largest size. With the 10s, there is a slight pressure on my fingertips at rest. Even the 11s still have my index, middle, and ring fingers touching the tips (thumb and pinky have a little bit of room).

Since they are leather, I assume they will break in a good amount? The 11s fit like a pair of gloves that are already broken in, but there is a little more extra material in the palms than I would like.

1.5. Skiers level
There are 3 levels when it comes to skiing 
       Beginners- Starting off cannot go past blue squared medium max levels prefer green level
       Intermediate- Can handle green with ease and can also have a relatively low amounts of difficulty with a Blue square hill
       Expert- Can handle all sort of hills that include (not limited to) Black Diamond, Blue Square, Green circle with ease and swiftness 

Now back to destinations as I've gave an intro above. Destinations are a key part in skiing and for most sports! There are always certain places you have to experience as an athlete. So I shall show you a list that will give insight to what place you're going  to ski at but also what level of skiing you should be at to experience these places to their full potential.

Whistler Canada!- Whistler is a wonderful ski resort in Northern Canada! Whistler offers a wide variety of ski hills for all levels of skiers. With around 38.5 Feet of snowfall annually Whistler should be on every skiers bucket list as most ski resorts cant compete with the deep and great snow that it possesses.                      

St Anton, Austria- This destination is very popular with expert skiers, and it has lots of off-piste terrain. Its vibrant atmosphere encourages top Apres Ski, making it world renowned and attracting people from all over the world. Even though it’s one of Europe’s premier ski resorts, it’s still quite affordable. If dancing on tables is your thing, St Anton is the place.

Snowbird USA- For skiing in the states, this Utah based resort is a must visit if you like it deep. It receives twice as much snow as some Colorado resorts, and has all sorts of terrain to explore. It’s a bit quiet at night, which could be an advantage or disadvantage depending on what you like to do in the evening after a day on the slopes.

Chamonix France- This beautiful resort and mountain town is world renowned for its variety of off-piste. There are also stunning views to enjoy, and a lively French town which is busy all year round. If you’re worried about the weather, there’s some good tree skiing in Le Tour and although it is a resort famed for off piste, there is still enough family friendly resort skiing. However, the ski area is not linked, but spread the length of the Chamonix Valley which makes it less convenient for high mileage intermediates.

2.Equipment!!! 
Equipment is probably my favorite thing to talk about when it comes to any of my hobbies so here I will show statistics with all of the equipment that youd need to go skiing with. (Comments may be added from personal experiences and opinion)

My personal experiences and opinions brands Top Five

1.The North Face- Just like the poll I have also chosen North Face as my number one in quality and great for skiing and all sorts of snow sports, or even just being in the cold. North Face comes at a high price, but believe me this is the best for all types of skiers.
2.Marmot- Marmot is similar to North Face as it comes at a high price.  With this high price comes great quality and reliability I only rank this second because North Face has better warranties such as a lifetime warranty. Still marmot is a great brand and can recommend it for everyone
3. Spyder- Spyder is a reliable brand as it holds up and the great part as it comes cheaper than The North Face and Marmot. I would recommend this for about everyone. 
4. Under Armour- Having owned a under armour jacket just a few months ago I was very pleased with the price it costed and the quality of it. Though I rank this in my top 5 I have had an issue that made get rid of it, but I still recommend for all.
5. Patagonia- For Patagonia it is an OK brand. I find Patagonia to be nice in fashion but I wouldn't want to go outside in 15 degree ski weather and not have many layers on. So for this brand I say you can buy at your own risk as it isn't the highest quality brand I've used.

Driving to Mammoth next week from AZ. Anyone have any advice for a first timer?,"What lodging would you all recommend? I'm on the grad student budget, but I know i'll have to pay at least 150 for 3 days. 

Any run recommendations for an ""advanced"" (I guess?) skier? I like to dabble in the park and hit mountain.

Also, thinking of bringing my Kartel 108s. Seem OK for the conditions? My K108s have a nasty base gouge (AZ rocks... not a core shot), but i'm told it's fine to ski on them before repairing if I scrape the raised portion off first? I have some ARVs i could take instead.

Living in Seattle vs Reno for skiing?,"I lived up the canyon in Boulder this past winter and fell in love with skiing. My job is flexible so I skied at Eldora almost every other day which allowed me to level up quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to do something similar this year and am considering moving to either Reno or Seattle in a couple of months.  I'm leaning towards the Ikon Pass since I have family in Boulder so being able to ski at Eldora and Winter Park is a plus.

&amp;#x200B;

It looks like from Reno I'd be about 30min away from Squaw and that it'd mostly be an uncongested drive. In Seattle the closest mountain for Ikon would be Crystal, which is almost two hours away.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd prefer to live in a town no smaller than Reno where there are things to do, access to an airport, and residents in their mid-20s.

&amp;#x200B;

Which do you all think would be a better place to live this upcoming season? Am I overlooking better options for skiing in Seattle? Would Seattle be better if I got a different pass (not Ikon)?",skiing,1559229087,geekjock,True,2019-05-30,1

First Ski Recommendations,"Hi y'all, I was looking to pick your brain on ski recommendations for a newbie.  I already got boots fitted and I know the best way is to demo skis, but I wanted to try and narrow things down as much as possible before demoing things next season, especially since the demo selection in my area isn't the greatest.

For my skier profile I'm 6’4”, 205, ski primarily in the East (VA/PA), at resorts, primarily groomers but I'm looking to Branch out to slightly rougher terrain next season.  I feel comfortable on blues/blacks but I know that blacks on the East Coast are considered easy.

What I think I'm looking for:
- 180+ length
- 86-90 Waist Width
- Stable at higher speeds, biggest issue I had on rentals was the wobbling when I was at higher speeds
- All-mountain versatility
- Can land occasional jumps, not a huge priority but definitely a plus

Potential skis
- Experience 88 ti - Probably my 1st choice, since I think this ski can handle everything I mentioned above and the reviews are all great.
- Volkl Kendo, Pinnacle 88, dynastar 88, experience 88 hd - Similar to the experience 88 ti from what I've read online.
- Blizzard Brahma - Worried the ski is more of an expert ski (too stiff) and I'll struggle too much with it.
- Atomic 86 Vantage - Seems like a better beginner ski, but I'm worried it's not as versatile and I could outgrow it.  Also only available at 181
- Seek HD - Worried it may be on the softer side and not good at carving.

Was wondering if anybody had any opinions on whether any of the skis I'm looking at would be a good fit for me, if there's any not worth trying, or if there's anything else I should consider.  Thanks!",skiing,1559306504,Snlxdd,True,2019-05-31,1

Ski and binding recommendation,"I'm 5'10 195. I have been skiing for my entire life and teaching since I was old enough to. Currently skiing and teaching at Alpental in Washington. 

Looking at getting Atomic Bent Chetler 100s wondering if I should go with the 180s or 188s trying to balance Alpental narrowness with being able to float on deeper days. 

If you dont like the ski, I'm open to other skis if anyone thinks they would be better. 

For the bindings I'm looking at marker jester 13s likely or the 16s if I need them. I'm a pretty aggressive skier so usually have my din at 11 or 12 depending on skis conditions ect. 

Again open to other options.

The Douchebag - can this ski bag fit 2 pairs of skis and poles?,"I was wondering if  [https://douchebags.com/the-douchebag](https://douchebags.com/the-douchebag)  The Douchebag can fit 2 pairs of skis and poles.  The videos and pictures I've seen mostly show one pair with bases down.

The Douchebag website states:  One pair of skis, poles, boots, helmet and apparel, or Two pairs of skis and apparel.

Why is NA skiing primarily off piste/ back country based?,"Why is the skiing norm in NA off piste style compared to skiing in the EU which is primarily on piste/groomers. 

To me it seems like NA are skipping a step. Learn to ski properly FIRST (carving, upper body blah blah blah) then specialise to freestyle/back country/groomers/racers or whatever. Then again, that doesn't stop skiers in EU from thinking they're better skiers than they actually are (i.e me). I find it hard to describe but here's an analogy: why start in the deep end when you can probably become MUCH better by learning in the shallow end. 

Sure I love a good off piste day, but why is it SO DAMN popular over there? Is it less infrastructure required? Less staff? More natural feel?",skiing,1559395708,Liocla,True,2019-06-01,1
Need New Daily Driver Ski,"Ok so its that time of year where all the 18/19 skis go on sale and I am long overdue for an upgrade. I'll mostly be skiing Monarch CO and theres a chance ill be moving to SLC so if that were the case I would be skiing Alta/Bird or Brighton/Solitude. Im too poor to have a whole quiver of skis so I need one ski that will do it all. I'm a pretty hard charger and the older I am getting I stay less out of the park and am skiing more trees, moguls, bowls, and doing a bit of inbounds hiking. I do a lot of solo skiing so no backcountry.

I'm 5'7'' 135lb 

Ive narrowed it down to these options

K2 marksman (170 or 177?)
Armada Arv 106 (172) (Ti version if I can find a good price)
Line Sick Day 104 (172)

If you guys have any recommendations let me know or if you have a suggestion that I haven't listed let me know. I want to try to stay under the $500 range on the skis if possible.

Help choosing skis,"Hi everyone,

I’m an avid snowboarder, but would love to learn skiing for snow on the firmer/bumpier side of things. Ie.

Boots recommendations?,"I’m planning to buy a new pair of boots now in the off-season (hoping to get a decent price) but could use some guidance from the good people of reddit.

I’ve not bought ski boots since my season 9 years ago so I’m very out of touch with the tech!!

Are there any particularly good models or features I should look out for?

I’m still a reasonably aggressive skier but now mostly “all mountain” (pistes with a bit of side/piste, trees etc.). I seldom venture into the park now and if I do it would just be to hit a few medium kickers, nothing crazy. My understanding is that a stiff boot would be good for me but feel free to correct me!

Thanks in advance!",skiing,1559503131,KopRich,True,2019-06-02,1

Early bird pass pricing?,"I’ve been buying a family pass at Nakiska for the last few years but my kids are starting to outgrow the hill. 

I was thinking I might consider Sunshine of Louise but can’t seem to find their early bird pricing (not posted yet). 

Anyone able to tell me what the price was last year?  I need to buy the Nakiska pass by Jun 15 and don’t want to miss out by waiting for Louis or Sunshine to post their rates.  

A general idea of last year’s price would help my decision.

binding/brake fitting questions,"So, I've got a pair of Jay Skis Master Blasters, measuring in with a 96 mm waist. I'm looking at some bindings from Look, specifically [Look NX-11's](https://www.evo.com/alpine-ski-bindings/look-nx-11), 100 mm width at the  brakes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Will the 4 mm difference be alright ? Could I size down to a 90-95 mm brake width, and get away with it ? I'm just interested in making the tighter possible package for bindings/brakes.",skiing,1558662539,de_mom_man,True,2019-05-23,1

"Tore ACL, getting surgery, how do I get out of epic pass?","So last season I had a twisting fall, doctor told me I may have torn my acl.  Fast-forward to this week and my orthopedic surgeon says I definitely tore my acl and meniscus.  He recommended surgery but told me he usually doesn't recommend getting back out until 9 month after the surgery.  With my current date that puts be back on the mountain end of March next year making my epic pass almost useless.  

1. Anyone else recovery from surgery faster?  What did you do before and after to get back on the mountain? 

2. If I'm really 9 months out before safely skiing again any ways to get your epic pass cancelled?  I only put down my 49 bucks but from what I've read Vail makes it basically impossible to get out of it regardless if you didn't get the insurance, and even with the insurance they only cover very specific things and you have to have the insurance before the injury.  

Do they send you to collections if you just cancel the card?  Dispute the translation when the full amount hits my account as services not received? 

Anything would help at this point...I've got some big medical bills and not burning the 700 bucks on a pass I likely won't use would help.",skiing,1558799640,steventw,True,2019-05-25,1

ADVICE on All-Mountain Twin Ski.... Bent Chetler 100??,"I’m on the hunt for a new all mountain ski to add to my quiver. I’m 6,1 and about 88kg (194lbs), sporty and athletic. I come from a slalom racing background and powder lines. I work as a ski instructor now and with all this being said I’d say I’m an expert level skier. 

My current skies include a pair 170 Fischer RC4 SLs and 190 Armada Magic Js. I’m looking for an all mountain ski to sit firmly in the middle of my current set up.

I love the stiffness of the RC4s when ripping around and I love the playfulness of the Magic Js but the waist widths and camber/rocker profiles for both ski are big limiting factors.

I need you guys’ advice on an all mountain (twin) ski that I can use for playing around day to day. Something relatively stiff and can hold up in turns but all something fun, poppy and playful for hitting jumps features and spins around the mountain. Something in the 90-100mm waist would be ideal for in and out of the powder and groomers. 

So far I’ve seen;
Atomic Bent Chetler 100s
K2 Marksman
Blizzard Rustler 9

I’m open to any suggestions you guys have...
Cheers!

Living In Singapore... Buy Boots Online?,"OK so, I've been skiing every winter for a few years now at various ski resorts(High1 Korea, Wanlong Beijing, Grand Massif France) for a few weeks at a time and I've decided to to make the leap and buy a set of gear for this coming winter when I'm going to Rusutsu Japan with a couple of friends. The problem is there are literally ZERO ski shops in like a thousand-mile radius around Singapore. I'm fine with buying skis and bindings online but I'm really not too sure about boots seeing all the warnings about buying boots online and having to get fitted first. I also don't want to take the risk and buy boots in Japan seeing as Rusutsu is quite a small resort and I'm not sure about availability or sizing or if they have the right model for me. I usually gravitate towards the more action-packed sports having previously ridden BMX and skated and want to try my hand at freestyle skiing ( so looking to buy freestyle-ish skis eg armada ARVs and hopefully fulltilt or Dalbello boots). I'm really not sure how to go on with this because the last thing I want is to go another winter with painful feet, ill-fitting boots and bruised shins from yet another pair of rental boots.

I really hope that some of you guys can consider my dilemma and maybe think of a solution that I couldn't think of!",skiing,1558956847,thatcrazypanda248,True,2019-05-27,1
