"Buying a board, need opinions on size.","I want to get back into snowboarding, havent done it in 10 years. Miss it so much. But i am having trouble figuring out the right board size. I am a skinny dude 135 lbs 5 ft 10'. My suggested size for my weight is 146, but i feel like i would enjoy a smaller board with more control, maybe a 135.

Beginner advice!,"So a little context, I used to ski, went riding for the first time this past Sunday at Hunter MT where they have a good beginner deal where you get lessons and rentals for $99.

Here’s the thing, while I feel competent enough to go down some bunny slopes my GF needs practice as it was her first time on a mountain period.

We went on the lift once at the end of the session and it did not go well :/

How do I help her progress where she is comfortable turning and being on her board without us breaking the bank?

A little more context: We spent most the time with a small group and instructor at the bottom of the mountain at a training area where there was a very very small “slope” to learn on and while she definitely was getting the hang of things she needs a lot of work to be comfortable getting off the lift and going down a slope",snowboarding,1579830507,Mcapp-1,True,2020-01-23,0
Burton snowboarding jacket sizing for a small guy,"I am no big guy by American standards: 5'6"", around 145 lbs. Clothing sizes tend to go with either XS or S depends on the brand. I've been shopping for a new Burton snowboarding jacket like this:

"What ""gotcha"" do you wish someone had told you back when you started?","So I bought a used board before the season started. It was a Burton board. I didn't think anything of it until the top started splitting so I brought it back and got a used Rossingol instead. No issues with it at all but while talking to the guy at the store he said ""You're likely better off without Burton anyways since a Burton board can only take Burton bindings. At least now, with Rossingol, you can try out different brand bindings and see what you like before investing in new stuff."".

It's just one of those little things where I had no idea. I just assumed everything was universal. Same with the board itself. I learned the Burton board was much stiffer (and less forgiving) while the Rossignol is a ""flex"" board so it's a bit easier on beginners (like me). I love the flexibility of the board by the way.

Foot pain while snowboarding - HELP," 

I was hoping someone might have some other ideas to shed some light on the foot pain I experience every time I snowboard. I feel like I have tried pretty much everything over the last few years to alleviate the pain but have had very little success and I am finding it very discouraging.

I experience extreme cramping pain in the sides of both of my feet. It starts just below my baby toe and goes to about half way down the side of each foot. This pain is bad and makes me takes more breaks and often I have to end my day riding earlier than my friends. It does not get better as they day goes on. Also, it is especially pronounced when turning from my heel edge to my toe edge (but I still feel it all the time) and usually worse in my leading foot (my left foot) but it hurts in both feet. It should also be noted that I have pretty flat feet and wear orthotics in everyday life- so maybe it has something to do with this? but I feel like the pain would be more generalized on my arches if my flat feet were the cause of the pain.

I have done research, tried many things and talked to lots of people to try to alleviate some of the pain with nothing really helping. Here are a list of things I have tried:

\- changing the stance and distance of my bindings on my board

\- buying new boots that a double boa system to control the tightness on different parts of my feet - as well as playing around with the tightness

\- custom insoles/foot beds for my boots

I am at a loss of what else I could do. It makes me sad because I really do like snowboarding but the foot pain kills me. Anyone have any other ideas?",snowboarding,1579897038,FluffySleepyKitty,True,2020-01-24,0

Should I go snowboarding this Sunday or rest to heal?,"Last Sunday while snowboarding I caught an edge and fell hard forward onto my rib cage.

I continued to ride for hours afterwards without any trouble. It isn't bad, I'm assuming it's just bruised because a broken rib must hurt a lot more, but it hasn't gotten any better since Sunday and has bothered me a tiny bit here and there, but not really at all during day to day stuff.

I’m going to Tahoe two days after my cast is removed and plan on riding. My doctor looked mortified when I told him this and didn’t have much advice to offer. I understand the risks and am looking for anecdotes and insight regarding anyone’s experience doing this. Also, in the case that the cast stays on an additional week or two, I would appreciate insight regarding riding with a cast. 

Also, I plan on ordering wrist guards for the future (probably Demon Flexmeters). I should be in a brace once the cast is removed, so I probably won’t be able to wear them on the problem wrist. I have never before used my wrist to break my fall, but it only takes one bad reaction, which I learned the hard way. If anyone has any brace or wrist guard info please fill me in.

Question about sizing down for a new board.,"Hey there, I’m not exactly a new rider. I have been riding for about 7ish years now. I have a question about board size for park riding. How much smaller from my current board should I go?

I’m a tall lean guy, 6’4 210 lbs, so obviously I need a board much bigger than the average rider. I currently own a 162W (I have size 12-13 feet depending on the shoe so obviously wide is good for me). Now, 162W isn’t actually too big for me. When you look at any board sizing chart out there 162W for a 6’4 210 guy is about right, but I wanna look into getting a smaller board for when I’m riding in the park. I know riders everywhere size down their boards for park riding, but my question is how much should I size down? I was thinking something in the 157W to 159W range. Is that too much? Too little? A guy who works at a local hill and rides park a lot recommended I try anywhere between 155W and 157W but idk, that seemed a little bit too small for me, am I wrong about that assumption? Let me know what size I should be looking at for park riding. Thanks.",snowboarding,1580108701,joellittjukes,True,2020-01-27,0

Lib Tech Orca sizing and if it's the right board for me,"Hey Reddit Snowboarders,

I've been watching/reading up on Lib Tech Orca for a while. When I was picking out my board for this season, I was wavering between Capita Super DoA or Lib Tech Orca. I ultimately chose the Capita Super DoA because I thought I was thinking of getting into park and switch riding. 

Long story short I didn't find the Super DoA to be enjoyable for me. Maybe because I'm an intermediate rider and didn't put enough hours in the park. I find myself being very comfortable riding only one stance and carving. Eventually I want to do more jumps and do ""some"" park features.

There's so much hype on the Orca right now and after watching the reviews on YouTube and reading articles on the web, many say that this board lives up to the hype. I'm thinking about selling my board to a friend and use that money to purchase an Orca.

Sizing is a bit tricky from what I heard. I'm 5'7.5"" weigh about 170 and wear 8.5M. They have 147 and 150 available. I asked the rep from the Lib Tech site and 2 people gave me different answers (147 and 150). What size do you recommend for me?

Application for automated volume control based on speed,"Hey snowboarders, a while ago I saw a post by  [u/backcountryeng](https://www.reddit.com/user/backcountryeng/) about his application that adjusts your phones volume when you hit a certain velocity (app name: Swift Volume). 

I recreated this application for Android as his was iOS only and I added some functionality. Instead of changing volume at a certain velocity, you can set two sliders (one for speed in km/h or mi/h and one for volume in %) to control your volume at every velocity for a smooth ride.

I GOT MY BOARD BACK!!!,"Because the thread was locked I guess I needed to make a new post to update everyone. Friends, I am happy to share with you that I found my Xavier De La Rue Rossi board yesterday afternoon. This is what happened. The post blew up so much that Jon Snowboard Thief’s ex-girlfriend’s former neighbor, who lives in Oklahoma, saw the post. She DM me and told me the guy looked familiar and that she would ask her friend, his ex, to confirm his identity. Minutes later I get another message confirming the guy is this girl’s ex. The girl in Oklahoma helps her and I exchange numbers and she calls me. Profusely apologizing for what had happened (she did sound sincere) she told me she knew where my board was and that she would go get it and meet me somewhere to exchange it. We set a time and place for when we both got off work. Thinking this was too good to be true, I had a buddy ride along with me just to be safe. My friend and I arrived five minutes before she did. She had my board. Apologizing on his behalf several more times she then left very quickly without ever supplying her name or his. 

So that’s it man. Hopefully the guy receives some form of justice down the road because that was the most uncool shit I’ve experienced in a while. Unfortunately, he’s still around somewhere so everyone just exercise caution. Keep an eye on your stuff.

Of course this is just speculation but I would wager that Jon Snowboard Thief saw this post on Reddit and got nervous. The internet, reddit in particular, just unloaded on this guy.

Advice for goofy rider but weight foot is the right foot?,"As a kid ski school told me I was a goofy rider even though my weight foot is my right. A dozen annual trips later I realized I'm standard.

I can get down at a good pace but my heel turns are always sliding out on the backfoot. I can't really do the steeper blacks because I have trouble controlling my turns. Air has always been hard for me as it's harder to keep weight back. Even getting off ski lifts in past was difficult with my weight foot in front.

Ski big 3 and kicking horse,"Hey here to give some output on these mountains for ppl deciding to take future trips.

1st January and february have cold punches (polar vortex) so double check with your crew. We were well prepped. But -30 gave a cold zip on groomers.

2nd check each mountain condition and visibility. Some get more snow. Some get more sun. Have a gameplan earlier, then double check in morning use snow-forecast.com

3rd Canmore vs Banff stay; Canmore better bang for buck kitchens etc. In lodges, also I think there is a shuttle from Canmore to Banff so double check. Rental car needed here and more versatile in choosing mountain.
Banff is closer to the hills and shuttles all over so if your comfortable with a little better and easier lifestyle go that route. More $$$ there too.

4. know what kind of rider you are and what kind of group your with. Banff sunshine is awesome for bigger groups and families once you reach the main village. As all those lifts funnel back to the main one. (goats eye lift seperate from more extreme riding)

Lake Louise little more adventurous but back bowls have long funnel back to the lift. Better to keep under 4 man team.

Kicking horse - (more advanced riding) not in the ski big 3 package but a favorite amongst locals for more extreme riding and a great layout for bowls to runs to tree runs. And back to the Gondala. So super cool for small groups to meet back at the bottom no matter the run. 

All in all cool trip, each mountain had its own terrain. Best snow was in kicking for me, most open terrain was Banff, most transfer runs lake Louise.

I'm cool to answer questions and have others fixing and giving more advice and suggestions.",snowboarding,1579460538,DominikSublime,True,2020-01-19,0

Real-world Waterproof ratings 10K/15K/20K and budget jacket recommendations?,"Hi all,   
I am up for a new snowboarding jacket.  
For those familiar with the Australian Aldi brand ""INOC"", I've rocket their older 3-in1 Snow Jacket (probably 2012-2014ish?) for some time now but yesterday was the last straw.  
Warmth wise (removable poly liner. No idea on gram weight), features wise I love the jacket.. theres nothing actually wrong with it and for the Aussie snowfields, I'd recommend it every day of the week.  
From my limited research, ive found some of their newer gear is 10K waterproof with the premium  version being 20K. I found an old ad from the 2014 Catalogue saying it was 5K waterproof so im not sure what rating my semi-ancient stuff is rated at but the collar of the shell does say ""waterpoof, Breathable and taped seams"".

Riding Cypress Vancouver yesterday, my ""waterproof"" jacket soaked right through in the freezing slushy rain in a couple of hours. 

I really need something more for the 'wet coast' conditions.  
I mainly ride Cypress &amp; Grouse, with one or two trips to Whistler or Revelstoke for reference.

**Im after some real-world feedback on how waterproof 15K actually is because that's about as far as my budget can stretch it seems.**  
Further to that, I'd be after some jacket recommendations with a max price of about $300CAD all in.

\-Must be waterproof.. The level of this is dependant on how my previous question is answered.  
\-Low to mid warmth rating but preferably not a shell.. I run pretty hot but don't want the inconvenience of layering up and having to stash base layers after I've warmed up. If and when I do trips to colder climates (Whistler/Revvie) Ill usually layer with a hoodie underneath.  
Lets say even with my budget Aldi gear, coldness has never been an issue.   
\-must have Pass pocket (Doesn't matter where, as long as it has a dedicated one.)  
\-Must have media pocket (Size is not an issue because I just listen to the radio on my little iPod nano)  
\-No camouflage, and preferably not black, dark grey or navy colour ways.

Ive also just picked up some TNF Freedom Insulated pants which I believe are 60G insulated and feature Dryvent2L.  Ive read this is equivalent to 15K waterproofing. They feel about as warm as I'd want to be (again, I would layer with 'Skins' on a colder day)

Any feedback or suggestions?

Pro tip for Big Snow at American Dream in New Jersey,"Bring all of your own gear, don't rent.

I wanted to share my experience with our first indoor snow park, it didnt go too well. I flew out to NYC for some work in the area, and I came a day early to visit Big Snow.  

I bought a pass+rental, put in my preferences (snowboard, height, weight, shoe-size) etc,.  I thought on a Sunday Night (but it is MLK tomorrow) it might not be too busy. It was busy (my first time so I dont know). 

The experience of checking in from the staff is all a bit vague and unclear of what to do where to go.  I didnt mind some of the attitudes, but I wasnt sure if I kept screwing up or what because I seemed to be in the wrong place every-time. 

Wait in line for your ticket time, wait in line for a safety video, wait in line for clothing, boots, all of it I totally get. But it being unclear on where to go, was a bummer.  All of the staff seemed flustered with the guest volume.

Once I got to the boot fitting area, I find out that they ran out of mens 10 to 12 boot sizes; the guy there said you will have to wait for boots to come back. 

By that point I gave up, and walked to the desk and got a refund. Honestly I'm a bit impatient when it comes to standing around in lines. They gave me a coupon for a free ticket but I may not be back here for a few months.

If I brought all of my gear, I would have avoided all of this. It looked like people were sneaking past the gondola video area if they had gear, and they also pulled people out of line because they had gear.

Im excited for what big snow could do for the sport, and bring new people to snowboarding who havent had a chance. So I hope it does well.

Looking for Jibby Snowboard setup buying advice,"I'm looking to buy a new snowboard setup (first new in 10 years) and I've decided to get a slower-paced forgiving jibby board. 

My current board is a Burton Jeremy Jones 2007 and I can't find much info on it on the internet. This [link](http://www.crazysnowboarder.com/EQUIPMENT/equipment.php5?item=1060) says the board only comes in 151 and 157, but I measured mine at \~154 flat so I'm not sure. It feels reasonably poppy (more than my first snowboard) and pretty stable at high speed, but I don't have a lot of experience on other boards.

I'd like to buy more of a jibby setup this time, something that you can really get squirrely with. I'm trying to find something I can just quickly and easily lean back and pop off any small or awkward feature or mogul and push off into an easy spin. 

I don't see many 'soft' profiles but I do see some 'soft-med'. Most snowboards I'm looking at are described like how I'm wanting, but the flex is usually 'medium' and that's in conflict with what buying guides describe. Likewise I've read that soft middle with stiff ends are preferred, but then I come across a board description that sounds like what I want buy says it has stiff middle and soft ends.... from what I can tell, a lot of board descriptions are either ambiguous or overly claiming. 

The more I look at boards the less confident I am ...

&amp;#x200B;

* Can I get the jibbiness I'm looking for from a medium flex board? 
* How does a soft-med stand up compared to soft? 
* Which parts of the board should be stiff and which should be soft?
* What should I look out for when owning a soft board?
* Should I match with soft bindings as well?

Basically the product is great, but the battery will fail within 2/3 years. Their aftersales support is pretty garbage, only offering me a (small) discount to re-buy a new set, not what I expect from such a premium product.

I guess if you go for full seasons or multiple times a year, you can justify the price for the amount of use you get out of them, but for me (1 time a year and 2 uses before failure), there's no way.",snowboarding,1579531003,JellyUK,True,2020-01-20,0

Upgrade from GNU Carbon Credit,"This is my first year snowboarding and I am advancing quickly on my 153 GNU Carbon Credit (5’8, 160lbs) with 32 Lashed boots that I purchased to help me learn. I live on the East Coast and tend to run into a lot of icy conditions. I strictly go with skiers and am starting to feel held back by my current snowboard. I am capable of carving and doing quick skidded turns down blacks, but don’t feel my board is always stiff enough to let me get some speed going before I end up in another skidded turn. My friends bomb down the mountain and I want to be able to at least come close to keeping up with them. I recognize that my snowboard will not make a huge difference compared to just practicing more, but I am going to get new bindings anyway and figured I’d upgrade to a new board. 

I noticed the Burton Custom is a pretty good intermediate board. Camber is something that interests me this time around. I was trying to get a list of some good snowboards for faster blues/blacks/double blacks as I am going to find myself doing those runs much more than park riding. 

Note: I will be doing Burton Step-On bindings this time around or I’m switching to skiing lol.",snowboarding,1579543177,XeroGravity_PC,True,2020-01-20,0

Looking for advice for purchasing a first board.,"I'm currently doing a season in Courchevel, and I'd really like to get my own board. I'm primarily a skier, and have been since I was 3, but I recently picked up snowboarding, and I'm finding it super fun! Very different to skiing, but similar enough in concept where a lot of my confidence has transferred across, and I'm finding I'm improving much quicker than I expected. 

I've done a good amount of research, as well as trying a range of boards to try and narrow down my tastes and my riding style, and I think I'm just looking for a strong All-Mountain board. After lots of research I narrowed it down to the Never Summer Proto Type 2. I've not tested it, but on paper it sounds perfect to me. Does anyone have any experience with this board, and can give me some advice one way or another? Or any other boards you think I should take a look at. 

Also in regards to bindings, I'm really liking the sound of the Union Falcor bindings. I definitely want something fairly stiff, if my experience skiing is anything to go by, but a little bit of flexibility when required sounds perfect. I wear 130s skiing, so I'm not too worried about discomfort. Again, if anyone can give me advice in regards to bindings, that would be great! 

For info, I'm ~75kg, 5'8-9""ish, and maybe a mid-high intermediate level boarder. I board very aggressively too, which I think comes from my skiing.

"Southwest ate my snowboard, will not pay for the damage","  

I would love some advice on what to do here.

I recently took a trip to Denver to go snowboarding, went to Loveland and it was great. Upon my return to Phoenix I grabbed my snowboard bag off the carousel and it looked like someone had taken a belt sander to it. My board also got split up one side, and the edge ground down and bent.

I will say, Southwest cut me a check for the value of my bag and some gloves that came out of the bag through the huge rip in it (though not the snowboard). I should add the flight had been delayed multiple times and changed gates before we finally departed from Denver. Collecting my luggage in Phoenix happened in the early morning hours of Monday, January 13th. I had to be at work in a few hours so I went home got ready for work and napped on the couch for a few minutes. After getting home from work I started unpacking my stuff only to find the belt sander had done damage to my snowboard as well.

I called Southwest to report the newly found damage only to get the runaround, and to be told I would be receiving an email from ""central baggage"" with more information. I waited 48 hours and no email appeared. I called back. This time I was told to upload documents and pictures via a web portal, which I did. I called back the next day and was told they had no record of me uploading any documents. Alas, I attempted a second upload, but this time decided to tweet @/SouthwestAir and see if it got a better response.

[https://twitter.com/andrewf63904166/status/1218659278363324416](https://twitter.com/andrewf63904166/status/1218659278363324416)

In summary, since I did not report the damage to the board within 4 hours, I was out of luck, according to their policy. They have offered me a $150 voucher to Southwest, but I really want them to pay to fix/repair my board.

I would really appreciate any advice for dealing with Southwest, or fixing my board.

Blacks in bumpy ice coast conditions.,"So I'd like to think of myself as pretty intermediate, I've been casually snowboarding for 10 years, got carving down on greens basically all the time, blues and blacks when conditions are decent.  What I'm stuck on is that near the end of the day, when there's bumps everywhere and the hill is not resembling anything near well-groomed, I can't carve on anything steeper than a green because I get scared of the speed and the lack of control from the hard-to-see bumps, and I end up scrubbing speed constantly.  I usually end up back at the greens at the end of the day cause at least there, I can still enjoy myself rather than feeling like I'm flailing slightly out of control.

Any tips in this situation?",snowboarding,1579717100,2102032429282,True,2020-01-22,0

Dedication,"I can't believe I just learned this. I've been snowboarding for over 3 years, I've been in Canada (WBC), Washington (crystal actual mt), Houghton, TC, Beulah (Crystal). 

Just tonight, and nowhere else. I did probably 15 different stretches, just to be ready. Readyness is everything baby, I just learned that (minutes ago) and that's why I suck. Because I'm never ready. I don't do yoga, I don't do stretches, and in 3 years I've barely learned anything. I can sort of 360, but it is awful in form. I'm terrified of big jumps. I don't soar, I pussy out. I want to be safe. 

Well, do you know what's more unsafe than anything? Not being ready to do what you're about to. You might think that because you exercise and do fitness and cardio and lift, you are ready. You aren't. Those muscles have almost nothing to do with snowboard. Your leg muscles help you gain air- they don't tell you anything about what to do in the air. You need to do stretches so you can learn of what is even possible to do while in the air, it is very different than having ground. You need to be able to wyrm like a cat. 

If you don't feel comfortable doing something (I don't feel comfortable going off of jumps) THERE IS A REASON. It's because **you aren't ready to do that.**

This is for all of you. If you're here, you want to be good at snowboarding. Watching good people is awesome and wholesome, and you want it too. You don't just want to be average, you don't want to be okay. Don't take that shit. Be great. You're here for PROGRESS not COMPLACENCY.

That's a message to myself, anyway. Maybe your experience isn't the same, maybe we snowboard for different reasons. But if you clicked on this post, you must've read the title, so let's face it. You're here for the same reason that I am- to be fucking amazing. Leave greatness in the dust, it is beneath you. You will soar, you just need to learn how.

If you want to soar, look up snowboarding stretches. Learn yoga. Learn meditation. You need mastery of your mind, and mastery of your body, to have mastery of snowboarding. There is nothing else, besides duality of mind and the mind that you embody. You need to master both. Mastery isn't a set point that you reach, it is a virtue- it is something you strive for. It is an unattainable ideal. Regardless, you need it if you want to do big shit without getting hurt.

Mastery is not about being here. Mastery is about going there. It is a method, not a static. It is something that you always need in order to progress. Without mastery, there is literally no progress. Think about that. You can't learn switch if you've never learned the opposite. You need to master your regular placement in respect to the mountain to even have an alternative. If you don't have mastery, it isn't riding switch, it's just riding and you don't have a regular way of doing that. Other words, you are lost and doomed.

Mastery is about balance. That's what meditation and yoga are for- balance of the mind, balance of the body.

 In snowboarding, there is no separation. You are constantly fulfilling your mind- what you expect to happen. You need to adopt a few seconds into the future, don't think of what to do but fucking know it. Don't imagine the future, know the future, intuit it. You have that control. If you catch an edge, you will fall- you know that. You know that you will fall before you do, and you know that you will catch an edge before you do- that's what makes you uneasy, which is what makes you catch an edge. The knowledge that you are about to fall. It happens before you fall, every single time. It means you weren't ready to do what you just did. If your adoption of the future includes you failing- you will fail. So, you need to get ready. Starting today, make a plan. Do 10 minutes of stretching before and after you meet the mountain again. You will FEEL the progress. That isn't a guess, I'm certain.

Those of you that are already dedicated, this is groundwork and you may think of me a fool to make such a big deal of it. But, I assure you that more than half the people on the mountain have no idea how to progress, and half of them will probably quit before they realize any of their potential, because they aren't progressing. Some of them will read this, and some of them will gain from it. That's why I'm making this post- I thought the only way to progress was on the mountain. Far from true, much of your progress comes before and after snowboarding.

Anyway, whether it's true or not, all of this came from DMT so imma plug that right here. Can't promise results, but if you go in with intention you can learn *a fucking lot*, ***about anything***, **about everything*****.*** Just wanted to share all of this with all of you, in case some might gain from it.

Well last year I started it got familiarized with the balance control and all the really basic stuffs... I decided to do 1h private class and in one hour private class and with a lot of falls i managed to side slide and do some small slow turns. After all 1st day practicing the 2nd day I decided to go to the green one, i did 2 laps on the green one and at the 3rd lap I fall back and i broke my wrist. This week I'm going back because I really loved it and want to ask you what can I do to prevent that happening again.

Btw I'm 189cm 70kg 44shoes and the board I had at that time was a 163W I felt really large and long and a lot of times I was diving the edges too much on the snow making me fall. Is this a good board for me?

"Hi, I just wanted to share a project I've been working on, please let me know what you think!","I've always liked to log my progress when learning new hobbies, so when I first started snowboarding a couple of years ago I recorded myself as much as I could, for learning purposes.

I started to hoard a big cuantity of videos over the time, so I decided to make a Youtube channel, where I could upload most of them. I decided to call it ""Snowboard Diary"" because, welp, it's kind of a diary where I log every day I've been on the mountain, with every video following a naming pattern of ""Day \# - Ski Resort - Run name"".

Now that I'm starting to see some progress on my riding I decided to start editing my videos with some music and stuff, and I really enjoy watching them from Day 1 onwards, and I was wondering if there's any nerd like me out there, who like watching this kind of stuff.

I don't have any intention of monetizing my channel, so it doesn't really matter if I get lots of suscribers, but I figured that since I'm putting some time into making it look as good as I can, I might as well share it with someone.

"Going to Japan for powder as a complete powder beginner, few questions for the pros","So I have been snowboarding for 4 seasons now, this is my 5th. I think I aam at an intermediate level where I have my form right, my slope riding is pretty good and I can do a few tricks in the park and a few butters.

1. Will my park board do for powder? Will it actively stop me from riding or just the experience will not be as good as with a powder board?

2. What kind of equipment do I need? Usually I wear a base layer, some wool mid layer or a sweater and a jacked which is not very warm but not just a wind shell either, normal jacket. Do I have to buy some new clothing or other stuff?

3. How essential is to hire a guide? Now as a complete powder newbies we won’t be going for the pro runs or whatever nor we need the perfect powder, propably will be hitting note powder beginner trails if there are any.

The Never Summer board is a CRC design with medium flex while the Sims Quest is a Flat Rocker that also has medium flex. Any advice on which board is best for my needs? Any and all advice/input is welcome and appreciated! Cheers!",snowboarding,1578962913,Sneakysnatch,True,2020-01-13,0

"Boards for 200lb 6'1"" rider","I'm currently riding an M3 Talon 163 wide and want something a bit more playful. It is a cambered twin shaped board. 

I'm looking to upgrade, but have the last 2 shops I've been in I've had either a really young kid who wasn't familiar with boards other than park, or a dude who just emphasized that anything I buy would be far better than what I have now without giving clear answers.  

This was my first board and I generally like it, but if I'm not riding fast and really leaning into my carves it does feel a bit oversized for me and my riding style. I don't do much in the parks, but I will hit some amaller jumps and boxes here and there.

Aside from rental Saloman boards years ago, the only other board I've ridden is a Ride (something) that had a rocker profile. I feel like a true rocker is a little to squirrelly for me, but can appreciate the ease of going heel to toe a slower speeds. Maybe I'm just accustomed to really trusting my edges or something, but when carving on my friends board I was constantly scrubbing and couldn't keep carves as clean. 

I would like something a bit more playful without compromising too much stability that I'm used to.

Union Stratas or Now Pilot?,"I’m looking into getting new bindings for my board this weekend. I currently ride a 2016 K2 Fastplant 159W. It’s a true twin flat bottom with medium flex. I currently have a set of Flow 5 bindings on it that are no longer keeping up with the way I ride. These bindings are not responsive enough and I have some heel lift no matter how much I adjust the straps and forward lean. I got them as my first set of bindings for the convenience of the rear entry.

I typically ride all mountain, shred groomers in the morning, tree runs, POW runs, hit some side kickers and a few drops depending on the mountain. I no longer hit the park after my concussion at the beginning of the season (hit the back of my helmet on the end of a box).

I’m looking into the Now Pilots ($279) mainly for the skate tech and the firm flex and the Union Stratas ($279) for the adjustability, firm flex, and the team high back is dope. The Union Forces are also an option I’ve considered. I’m choosing between these two brands because my local shop carries these two brands of bindings exclusively and I have a $100 gift card to use.

Lost video with a trick that doesn't exist,"Hey /r/snowboarding!


I'm hoping you can help me find a video that was posted on this site about 3-6 years ago. I believe it was in /r/videos but it began with a talented boarder sliding straight down the hill with his board sideways to the song Changes by Brooke Candy. Sideways meaning that the board was 90 degrees turned with the lad facing forward. As the pace of the song picks up, he hops out of the slide and does some cool tricks in a montage-style fashion.

I tried finding the video and thought that searching the trick would lead me there. However, I am not well-versed enough to locate it.

Any help is appreciated! It was such a well edited video and I would love to see it again",snowboarding,1579119218,ComplimentsAreFree,True,2020-01-15,0
"Boot pain in forefoot, Setup hasn't changed, Help?","TL;DR setup that worked well past 2 years now hurts so bad, i cant make down one run without incredible pain, Anyone ever had something similar?

Went for my first day this season this past weekend and was having ridiculous foot pain on the very first run, and even hurt on the lift back up, so much so people on the chair were like ""are you ok?"" After this, went into lodge, took boots off and stretched out my foot, but the pain really wasn't there when my boot was off. Went back out, pain was a little less, but was like going from a 10/10 to a 9/10. only had 2 more runs before i had to call it b/c it was soo bad.

The pain is/was pretty much only on my [forefoot](https://i0.wp.com/www.kintec.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Forefoot-Pain.png?w=385&amp;ssl=1), even on the ride up the lift it was still burning like crazy. Normally my boots will hurt a little for the first run of the day but will get better as the work-in during the day. The pain felt like i was only standing on my forefoot the entire time, like tip-toeing at all times but i cant feel any heel lift (inside my boot, just standing in my boots feels like the whole boot heel is lifting)

Figured my bindings were too tight, messed around with straps to no avail. Maybe high-backs are too far forward, moved back to do nothing. bottom of boots too tight, turned out they were pretty loose to begin with. Maybe liners to tight, nope. Tried pretty much everything i could think of, with barely any improvement.

My setup (im pretty sure i didn't mess with any mounting during the summer but not 100%) hasn't changed for the past 2 season, since i got these boots, and everything has been fine. I have footbeds in my boots and have been heat molded with them in.

One thing i could possibly think of is that the front part of my footbed got really hard and not cushion-y over night (had boots in cold car overnight) but that just doesn't seem right.

And another thing, when i was on a cat-track, i felt as though i HAD to stay toe-side (and really bent knees too) just to keep straight/flat base. My boots are very stiff Could i may have my binding mounted too far to heel side causing me to compensate by leaning over all the time?

I'm just really confused on how things could change sooo drastically with no (possibly) setup changes from last season.

I'm just looking for info/discussion on what to do/try (sorry for the wall of text)",snowboarding,1579119764,clowesclause,True,2020-01-15,0

Question for fellow shredders in Japan right now,"Hey guys,

Will be heading to Japan to ride and explore at starting the last week of January and I haven't booked any resorts on Hokkaido. From what I'm seeing, Hokkaido has been getting very little snow. My schedule is only set for for the first few days of my trip in Tokyo. The rest is a fluid 2-3 weeks that I plan to play by ear based on conditions; if it's good in the beginning then' I'll hit up Hokkaido, If not I'll head to Kyoto/Osaka and ride at the end of my trip.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also not set on a particular resort and just focusing on chasing that deep pow feeling. So I'm indifferent to the spot on Hokkaido as long as it's relatively easy to get to and there aren't too many flats where I'll need to unstrap.

&amp;#x200B;

Snowboarding in New Zealand,"Hey guys, I know this question probably gets asked all the time but im looking for some info aroud the best places to snowboard for a New Zealand first timer. 
Im heading to NZ in August and looking to be there for about 2 weeks with my brother. I have boarded Furano in Japan, Whistler in Canada and Park City in Utah before but this will be my brothers first time.

I have done a bit of research but I feel like it left me even more confused than when I started. Am I best to get an Ikon Pass and stay in Queenstown? I was planning on doing one mountain for the entire 2 weeks but they seem fairly small in comparison to PC and Whistler so im worried ill get a bit bored after the 5 or 6 day mark. We would be sticking to blue and green runs only i'd imagine so ive ruled out Treble Cone despite most people saying it gets the best powder. 

Do most people get the shuttles from Queenstown to the mountain each day? An hour drive to get to Cardrona and back every day seems pretty full-on but if thats the norm im more than happy to commit to it.

New Snowboard Help!,"Hello guys and girls of the snowboarding community,

This is my first time posting here! Here is a bit of background, I have been snowboarding for about 4 years, completely self taught. I never really had anyone to teach me things but I think I have gotten to the point of being alright. I currently ride a 2013 K2 Raygun, the green one with forests on it. I love it, it was my first snowboard ever. I don't know what I'd consider my boarding level... I ride blues mostly because the friends I go with are newer. I ride them perfectly fine and have no issues. Last year I practiced on a lot of toe side stopping from speed and am not comfortable with all of that. I have started to carve and do a pretty solid job, don't have the fear and panic anymore of toe side carving. The one thing I have yet to do is hit the park or any type of flat board / mini jump. 

I plan to get into that this season, but I would like to get any kind of advice on maybe a checklist or things I should be comfortable with before starting there. 

I also want to buy a new snowboard, mines perfectly fine but I have been itching for a new one that suits my style and colors better. I have been looking heavily at the Capita (I have this obsession with wanting a Capita board) DOA 2020. I was wondering if it would be a good board for me. Something I can work on that still has that park capability and isn't overall unforgiving. 

If you need anymore information I would be happy to say it! Thanks and I look forward to your advice.

Burton Women’s Yeasayer Flying V 2019 Snowboard,"I have looked all over the internet for this snowboard (link below).

Does anyone have any advice to find this sold out board, preferably  size 152? I’ve looked on eBay and even some foreign sites (I’m in the US) to no avail. What are the chances of getting one if I contact Burton? Honestly price or if it’s used is no problem for me at this point. Thanks in advance for any help/advice.

Boston Carpool/Snowboarding adventure buddy this weekend,"
Hey hey! I’m looking to go up to Jay Peak this weekend either late tonight or early Saturday morning and head back to Boston anytime Sunday. 

I’m a beginner in boarding and will probably take some more lessons while we’re up there, and just really love the vibe of ski resorts. My carpool fell through so thought I’d see if anyone would be up for a semi spontaneous weekend trip! 

I already have a room booked for 2 nights, so you could stay with me for free. I’m looking for someone who either has a car and wouldn’t mind driving (happy to split gas and take turns driving), or someone who’s down to split the cost of a rental car and take turns driving (about a 4 hr drive total). Once we get to the mountain we can buy tickets/rentals/lessons from there (totally cool if you’ve never been! I’m still a beginner lol). 

About me: works hard and parties harder, big on dancing terribly and strengthening friendships, telling funny stories with dark humor late at night, and pushing limits re goals all the time. 

If you might be interested, please message me with some info about yourself that’s more insightful than just listing your name, job or hobbies. We could potentially meetup for a drink tonight and see if we click!",snowboarding,1579286852,Material_Elevator,True,2020-01-17,0

Backcountry “course” worth it?,"I’m a very experienced snowboarder who’s been itching hard to get out into some real backcountry. I live in New England and have my eyes on the White Mountains area as a place to start skinning up on a splitboard and earn my turns.

I’ve been riding for 21 years (and skied 3 years before that) and I’m comfortable anywhere on the mountain, in bounds or not. My favorite place to be is in the trees, hence my desire to hike for some backcountry tree runs (less interested in venturing out into avalanche terrain, at least for now).

My question is, would it be worth taking a course on backcountry riding in which you venture out there with a guide and small group? Alternatively, I’d try to go with a buddy who’s a similar level or find someone who’s a member of some of the outdoors / backcountry groups in the area, but that may be more difficult to coordinate.

I ask because there’s an event called the Mount Washington Backcountry Festival coming up in March, and they offer a variety of full-day courses for $160 each. Questioning whether that cost is worth getting out there with a guide though when I’m already comfortable riding trees.

Rossignol rental package difference?,"Hey all!

My crew  is headed to Breckenridge  for the first time in 3~4 years to board. We get to chose between a Rossignol One LF or a Rossignol exp3 rail.

The rest of my group is going with the EXP3 since it is the ""beginner"" package but I am slightly concerned that it may ride too ""Icy"" at speed. We probably  won't  be going above double blue squares so maybe  I'll  never  get to the point where it matters between the two.

Insoles for boots,"After some recommendations on brands etc for some insoles for my boots to reduce size and minimise heel lift.

Long story short, when I bought them, it was my first pair of boots and I probably rushed into it and didn’t take the time or care to get boots that fit properly or have someone knowledgeable help me out. I treated them like buying normal shoes. 
Yep, they fit, okay I’m good- I’ll take these thanks.

They are realistically half a size too big. 
(I remember not getting the smaller size because I really struggled to get my foot in and out of the boot at the ankle cuff- even these I have to loosen them right up.)

As a result, as my boots have worn in and softened up I’m getting more and more heel lift. Toe space in the boot is fine and I seem to have good toe control.

This may also be the cause of the arch pain I experience on the top of my foot after a good few hours boarding. I do not normally wear or need insole for any kind of support in any of my other shoes.

For reference, the boots are K2 Rykers and I wear football socks when riding. I’ve experimented with double socks and big thick wool socks, but want a real solution. 

Can any recommend some brands or types of insole I can use to fill in the heel of my boot a little bit and minimise the heel lift? (Buying new boots is not an option)",snowboarding,1578592731,dwarfmarine13,True,2020-01-09,0

DIY Swallowtail advice needed,"Hey guys, so I have an old board lying around and I realized it's a perfect candidate for a powder board. Listen to this: 166w, directional full rocker. That's like a powder heaven and I thought I could make it even better and make a swallow tail out of it.

But, what I've been thinking is how does the bottom edge of the cut-out look like? Because if I'm thinking correctly, if I would just do the cut-out and leave the bottom bevel just like that it would bite into the snow when riding switch. But, if I were to make the bevel nice and round it should solve the problem right? 
Because at first I thought of it as a no-brainer, but than I checked some pictures of actual swallowtails and I couldn't spot the bevel in the pictures, so that got me concerned if I'm missing something, else why wouldn't it be everywhere.

Could anyone help me out?

Looking for parts to fix an old pair of bindings?,"Delete if not allowed apologize in advance since I’m new here

I’m just looking to see if you guys know where I can buy some individual pieces to fix this old pair of burton bindings that I have to give to a buddy of mine so he can ride this season

Long story short me and my friend took our boards out for the first time this season yesterday and both ran into some binding issues early in the day that left us with an eventful first day.

My boy borrowed a pair of beater Lamar bindings I keep incase a friend needs them. As he strapped in for the first run of the day, the straps snapped into pieces and the hi-back cracked off the screw that mounts it to the base plate. We were able to get new straps but he ended up having to use some clear tape to secure it down to the binding for the day (bad photo of it included in link, will add a better picture later)

I don’t even know how my hi-back snapped but i noticed it was destroyed until after the second run of the day (white freestyles in pics) but it’s shown but I called my local shop back home and they said they have a set of hi-backs on some old bindings they use for donor parts if I swung by there after we were done on the mountain. I ended up just getting the whole binding from them and taking the toe straps and disks from the broken freestyles

All that said now this brings me to the main reason for this post and the question at hand. This whole situation left my buddy without bindings for the remainder of the season and neither of us are in the position to buy brand new ones so I’m wondering if you guys know anywhere I should look to buy replacement parts to fix these freestyles so that  we can get back on the mountain before season end? As it stands it needs a right hi-back, toe straps for both sides and the disks. I figure it’s gotta be cheaper to fix them than to buy a new pair of bindings so any advice helps

Looking for tips for getting more stable off the groomers,"I've been riding for a couple seasons, mostly sticking to groomed blue and green runs and occasionally trying a black. I'm usually able to get down those without unintentionally catching air and going head over heels, but it takes a lot longer due to me being uncomfortable bombing step terrain and going down sideways to slow myself. This makes it a lot less fun. I'm trying to get more comfortable riding on bumpy, variable, ungroomed snow. The things I have been told to do and lately have been better about doing are making sure my knees are bent more than I think they need to be so I feel stable, and keeping my weight back on steeper/more powdery terrain, which helps keep me from wiping out but doesn't make riding steep/ bumpy terrain any more fun for me. I'm usually relieved when I get to a point where it flattens out enough to return to my comfort zone of carving. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!

Snowboarding sizing/ Freestyle choice,"Hey all,
Been snowboarding on and off a few years ( like twice a season for 16-17 and 18-19) but this season I’ve been about 10 times and hope to keep it up. 

Currently I’m rocking a 2017 DC ply so it’s definitely time to upgrade. Aiming for a freestyle board for jib/pipe, as well as butter/ 180/360/etc on the slopes(didn’t really want to call them idk spins?), which I suppose is also freestyle but it’s what I enjoy most. 


My top choices (in no real order) 

1. Twin pig (RIDE)
2. Headspace (GNU)
3.  GREATS (YES) 

Was curious if anyone had any input on these boards. I’ve only ever owned the one board so really not sure how any others compare. If you have another recommendation please let me know.

Was this guy trying to finesse me or should I be listening to his claims?,"It’s a really odd and long story, I hope it’s not confusing

I’m very new to the sport and this guy came up to me and asked to race down the mountain. I lost pretty hard but we took the lift back up together. 

On this lift he talked about his board non stop, eventually convincing me to try it. It was a extremely fun and stable board compared to mine, I was able to do a lot of things that would get me in trouble on my board. 

Eventually he showed me a secret pow spot, and had me ride his board down it.  

All this was great and all, but it just seemed odd.  I barely met this guy and he was willing to let me try his board and show me a untouched pow spot? He asked me to show him my pass, and asked if I was born and raised in Colorado which just seemed way odd. 

This last thing he told me was that his board was going to be sold out soon, and if I wanted his board with that graphic I should buy it soon as possible. 


Honestly I am down with buying the board if it’s true, the board was really fun, and I like the graphic as-well. Though normally I would I wait for a sale or something, but I willing to purchase it now if that’s the case. 

It was just a really odd event to me. Most time people aren’t that nice or welcoming. Was he trying to sell me the board or something else? I’m just confused to be honest. 

The board was a Orca Lib. 


Tldr. Guy showed me a pow spot and let me use his board, and told me I should buy it before it’s to late. Felt extremely odd.",snowboarding,1578671724,GodBorn,True,2020-01-10,0
Rental car tires in Denver during February weather,"Hey everyone! Me and about 4 of my friends are flying in to Denver, Colorado (DIA) on the night of February 19th and staying until the evening of February 27rd (8 days). We are planning to stay about 30 minutes (or less) away from Echo Mountain, where we plan to go snowboarding the first couple of days we are in town. We were just about done planning the trip when we realized it might be difficult to navigate the roads in the weather conditions that February is likely to bring, especially during the later hours of the day. 

When going over some of the car rental companies near DIA, I found that none made any mention of snow tires or chains for driving in snowy conditions. I also found many forums saying that rental companies do not provide either of these two, but do usually provide M/S tires (Mud/Snow) that are in accordance with the traction law ""code 15"". However, seeing that none of us have driven in moderate to severe snowy/icy conditions, we were concerned by whether M/S tires would be enough to drive up the mountain roads from Denver to Echo Mountain. 

Also, do you guys have any tips/tricks that might help us if we decide to just go with the M/S tires. Seeing that they are in accordance with the traction law, I'd assume they are safe, but we rather be safe than sorry. 

Sorry if this isn't the best subsection for this question. I would just like to get input from people who likely have driven snowy roads, Colorado or not.

And just to be clear, I'm talkin about the vids where its above and behind, you have full view of the rider from feet to head, can clearly see what he's doing etc. I think the Rylo cam was supposed to be specifically designed for this type of shot (maybe? idk). Also see a lot of vids from Insta360 like this.

I'm really working on my content, and well I have the normal selfie stick mini tripod deal for filming with friends, but and ride alone a lot, so trying to figure out better ways to do this, which is why I thought I'd give this camera a shot. Helmet/chest cam footage is honestly super fucking weak, and Tripods are nice but you can only do so much with that. And I don't like leaving my tripod on a 40 foot + jump cuz I'm not hiking back up that shit.

So I'm HOPING I can buy or build some kind of mount that would work for me. It needs to not cause me an injury, because lets be real I fall a lot lol. And if I'm going inverted and it smacks against the ground it would be great if it doesn't snap in half. And the movements are obviously pretty jarring when landing big airs and tbh even jibbing, so the mount needs to hold steady ish reasonably well I think?

Is this realistic? I hope so, cuz well I own it already lol

I'm planning on buying my first board. Now I have read a lot about how important you weight is compared to your height when choosing one. However I did overlook waist width a bit. I am rocking some US 7 (men) boots, will I have too much trouble when I get a board with a waist around 246?

Slash ATV,"Hey everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking around to buy my first snowboard, and while I've been boarding before and can make it down a run without falling, I'm definitely still a novice. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been looking around on Craigslist to see what's around to buy used because I don't want to drop $400+(CAD) on a board. I found a Slash ATV from 2015 that someone is selling for $240. My question is, is this an alright board to learn on? I keep seeing that it's aggressive and not great for beginners due to the traditional camber. This doesn't make much sense to me because most, if not all boards were made like this in the past. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also went into a shop yesterday and one of the guys showed me the Never Summer West. That board was a lot more flexible and had a rocker hybrid profile, which from my research seems to probably fit my style more, but it's $459 CAD. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for what I want to do on it, I don't know to be honest. I won't be hitting the park, I know that much. Mostly just downhill and trying to learn some buttering and carving. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any insight would be much appreciated as to what route I should take, I'm also open to other boards. Feel free to educate me on anything related to camber profiles, and let me know if I'm overthinking things. Thank you!",snowboarding,1578773498,VacantMindz,True,2020-01-11,0

Wrong board model or size? Capita DOA.,"Per recs from here I purchased a 2019 Capita DOA in 158W - super fun board as advertised! However, after about 8 days on it, I've noticed it's very unstable on ice. Not great on choppy hard packed snow either at high speed. 

Sizing wise I was right on the boarder between a 158W and 161W. I'm 6'2, 205lbs and size 12 foot (was 198lbs when I got it lol). 

**Do you think the lack of stability is more because my size is too small? Or the DOA model itself? If it's the model, what's a better one you'd recommend? Twinpig/warpig looks interesting.** 

The board is awesome in the park but I'm 50/50 between mountain/park and on the East Coast so ice is an issue sometimes.

Boot adjustment reccomenations? (Nitro Team TLS 2020),"Hi all

I ride the 2020 Nitro Team TLS and recently started to notice severe pressure on my right heel, but just on the left side.

When trying them on I did not notice anything and the first few days of riding the boot fit perfect. Now with them being a bit more broken I have one pretty uncomfortable spot. Right next to my achilles tendon the heel support is pressing against my heel so hard that after a few hours of riding my foot starts to tingle and I have to take a break and loosen up the shoe. Weirdly, this just occurs on the right foot on the left side. Not both sides and not on both feet.

Any recommendations on how to fit the boot properly? Is there such a thing as warming your inner shoe as one can do with hardboots? Or how do you handle pressure points?

In now way do I want to return the boot. It's one of the best I've ever had. Sizing is perfect for my feet, they have the right flex and are super comfy. And most importantly: they don't disappoint taking heavy impacts from kickers.

So other than the one sqare inch where they suck they are perfect.",snowboarding,1578906951,fryie,True,2020-01-13,0

I made an app for boarders that adjusts your music volume based on your speed,"I love riding with music but always found it a headache to reach for my phone and change the volume non-stop in the cold.

Whistler vs Mammoth???,"Planning on heading to either Whistler or Mammoth for a week.  Have never been to either.

2. Which has better lift capacity to the parks?  Or which will have shorter lines?

Anyone been to either mountain during this week?  How crazy are the lift lines for the park chairs?

Snowboard sizing advice 5 ft 7 (170cm)/ 132 lbs (60kg),"I know this has been asked a million times but I'm really losing hair over this.

I'm going to buy my first snowboard. I have rented and gone snowboarding many times before. I am very confident with my turns and steep hills.

My style is carving, switching, buttering (imagine a shitty version of Ryan Knapton's style) and an occasional Ollie here and there - I want to improve on all of this. I don't really plan on bombing hills super fast, except the usual when trying to keep up with friends.

It's difficult finding a 150 cm board that's not sold out (I live in Sweden) so I'm wondering if you guys think that it'd be fine with 152 or possibly 154? Or should I stick to 150?

I checked out my friends 154 cm board and it goes all the way up to my upper lip. I may gain a little weight as I've started working out again and I usually plateau around 143 lb (65 kg) if that matters.",snowboarding,1578939744,Robaru,True,2020-01-13,0

Do i need the wider version, the 159w, or is the normal, 159, version fine ?

This is the wisdom of the mountain,"The mountain is face as fuck. It is tall as fuck. That's how we've defined it. That's the difference between a mountain and a hill, a hill is pretty fucking tall but a mountain is tall as fuck. It's wrong, it shouldn't be tall. There is no reason for tall on a sphere. It should be fixed. That's why we have snowboarding, to fix the tallness. We push snow to the bottom to fix it, to make it not tall (cause remember there's no reason for tall on a sphere, it is wrong). When we're all done, there will be no mountain, just feet of snow. A lot of feet of snow, it will be smooth though. Great for shredding. If you could just find a place to fall from. Like a mountain. Well shit. You need the mountain to board. Without the mountain, there is no fall, there is no shredding. This is what we mean when we say the mountain will fall. Of course it will, that's all it does, is fall. The mountain falls, because we are the mountain and we fall from the mountain. That's all anything does, is fall. That's what gravity says we do, and gravity is just a term that we made up to say ""this happens"". Falling happens, always. We can't get around that, because we created gravity like 20 years ago and now we're all trying to fix it but the more we try to fix it, the worse it gets. we learned that fixing things is actually fun so now we keep breaking it just so that we can keep on fixing it. and now we have snowboarding. frickin cool. I love emergence. 

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, by snowboarding, we are pushing snow to the bottom of a mountain, to fix the mountain, to make it no longer tall as fuck, but just fuck because it isn't tall anymore. And without the tallness you can't shred. Anyway, what I'm saying is we're doing God's work, we're making the mountain fall on itself. I mean, where else would it fall? Off the mountain? The base is just as much mountain as the summit is. All there is, is mountain. Even dips and valleys, are just inverted mountains. The earth? Just a sphereical mountain. You can confirm this by thinking about where a mountain ends. Where does it end? The smoothness at the bottom? Well, what is the bottom? It's not the surface level, I'll tell you that much. It's below the surface, wherever rocks form- because a mountain is just a huge (read: tall as fuck) rock covered in snow. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what I'm really saying is, there is no wisdom of the mountain, because mountains are freakin stupid and that makes snowboarding stupid. that's why it's fun, because it's stupid. it absolutely does not make you athletic, there's a huge risk of injury, and the only thing you get out of it is fun. that's why it's stupid, because it's fun. nothing that is fun, isn't stupid. get that? why is drinking fun? because it's fucking stupid, it's just poisoning your body on a small scale. why is dancing fun? because it's fucking stupid and pointless. if you make it exercise, then it isn't fun, it's just work. that is the separation in life, there is work and there is fun. work is smart, because it allows you to have fun. you can't have fun if you didn't eat and now you're dead. right?

&amp;#x200B;

if you made it all the way through, god bless you you stupid fuck. you're as dumb as I am. enjoy the mountain. do lots of drugs. never stop having fun, or you might as well die because the only thing left is work and who the fuck wants to work without ever having fun. you need both for a healthy balanced breakfast, choose kellogs. sorry for being so harsh, truly, I love you all.

I need camber underfoot, earlyrise(rocker tip and tail) and a directional stance. My only complaints are the flagship is too long at a 164. Previously I had a jones explorer and I snapped it at a 159. I hear the ultra series you can size down, wich is what I need after the flagships length makes it hard in the trees. 
Me as a rider I am 185, 5,10. I mostly ride Tahoe area with a couple hikes a season, and trips to Colorado and Utah. I love powder and groomers( the flagship has allowed me to advance as a rider. It just lacks freestyle abilities.) I liked the explorer it just wasn’t strong enough for me.

The most important lesson I’ve learned in all my snowboard progression.,"I’ve only been boarding for about 4 years, but living in a ski town and riding all season, it’s been enough time for a lot of progression and I’ve noticed a trend. I always improve the fastest when I’m doing things that scare me. For example, I had been spending a lot of time in the park hitting the same jumps over and over trying to dial in my takeoffs and landings. I was making progress, but the progress was slow. After staring to get bored, I decided in a burst of courage that I would try the much larger jumps to the side. I managed an ok landing after flailing through the air and decided to go back to the small jumps some more. To my surprise I was suddenly vastly more confident, able to keep more speed going off the lip, and stick the landings. Same thing happened when I started riding switch. The steeper runs where I was more scared had me improving much faster.

What should I do?,"Height: 6' 1""

Weight: 170 lbs.

Shoe Size: 12 U.S. (men)

Skill: Intermediate 

Heading out to Steamboat this Wednesday for a good 4 days of boarding. The last time I was on a mountain was roughly 3-4 years ago. Board I have is a 155 Burton Verdict with Burton Freestyle bindings. The snowboard boots are now too small for me to wear - size 10. I am wondering if I can still get away with this board or if I am better of renting one. Obviously, I would buy new boots but I worry they might hang off a tad and interfere with my carving. I plan to pick up boarding regularly again (3-5 times/year) so maybe it's in my best interest to invest rather than spend 200$ renting? The final option is my buddy has a 158 Flo board/bindings with some new balance boots around my size he'd be willing to sell me for $100. Said it may need a tune-up ($55). However, is 3cm really that big of a difference? I'm assuming it may come down to the width of the board. Looking for suggestions, please!",snowboarding,1578291741,bwolff97,True,2020-01-06,0

Binding setup for switch? Board recommendations?,"Hi All,

I've been boarding for 15+ years but with only maybe 50 days in total. I've recently been working on improving my switch riding to be more proficient at park stuff in general. I also have a goal of landing a backflip for the first time this season.

I recently got the Rome Reverb Rocker 2018 (https://www.evo.com/outlet/snowboards/rome-reverb-rocker-snowboard-2018) and it is great as an all-mountain board, but here are the challenges:
- I have no idea how the bindings should be set up for park riding
- More than half of my season this year will be in heavy powder regions, and this board is only ""okay"" in powder
- The board is fairly stiff, making it difficult to perform gnarly presses and butters

Currently my bindings are set up symmetrically at +/- 15 degrees. The high back angle was set to 3 for my lead foot and 4 for my back foot, but this gave me waayy too little control riding switch. I changed them to 4/4 and it was a bit better, but I still felt way too much difficulty turning the board. Not sure if this is because I am still relatively new to switch, or if a setup change will make a big difference.

And with the board, it seems to be pretty good ""all around"" but I'm concerned that it's neither here nor there for the two types of riding I'll be doing (park and deep powder). I've been eyeing the Eiki Lobster (https://www.evo.com/snowboards/lobster-eiki-pro-snowboard) because it seems really soft and good for park stuff but idk...

Advice for improving at jumps,"Sorry if this violates the ""noob"" policy but I checked the FAQ and don't believe it does. If I am wrong feel free to delete my post.

I just got done with my first trip of the season and while typically a downhill boarder, my friends and I were feeling inspired to try to work on our park game. I have been snowboarding for over 15 years, if infrequently, so I'm not new but have really avoided parks most of my career after breaking my wrist pretty bad going off a jump when I was younger. Nonetheless I was going into this season wanting to push myself to be a better, more well rounded and confident snowboarder this season.

While I've always been confident with my board on the ground, for some reason I really just seem to have trouble once I get airborne. I'm not exactly sure how I should be trying to distribute my weight in the air and when landing. I tried a few different things like leaning a little more forward, a little more back, dropping lower when I land to absorb more impact, but more often than not I am just eating it when landing. I even took one of the steeper jumps which was a mistake because I absolutely lost control in the air and crashed forward hard on my chest and head the second my board touched down (thanks god for helmets, I was just shaken up no concussion or anything). So the confidence to push myself is there, but the technique is very lacking.

I'm also curious about how the positioning of my bindings affects this. I ride normal with my forward left foot angled about 20 degrees out and my rear right foot straight forward. Sometimes I feel like the stance causes me to drag a little sideways in the air when I take off. I was thinking about switching to a straight forward foot and angling my rear foot slightly outward for when I park, but that's just speculation based off feel and I don't know if it's advisable.

I see quality OC here all the time of experienced riders effortlessly taking jumps and doing tricks. I don't need to be doing backflips by the end of the season but I would really like to fix whatever mistakes I am making and get better at this aspect of snowboarding. I hope this post is detailed enough for the mods.",snowboarding,1578329906,RonaldinhoReagan,True,2020-01-06,0

"Advice req: how to turn in tighter tree runs, esp powder?","TLDR: how to I make faster turns when I’m in the trees? (Similar to turning between moguls)


Hi all, after some advice on how to improve my technique a bit.

Been riding for a season and a half now, but mainly riding the Local Vancouver mountains.

I’m 6’ and 85kg riding a 161W Bataleon Whatever.

I can ride groomers all day long and can ride open bowl and glades of powder but I just can’t ride tree runs and similarly, really deep moguls. 

I often find myself starting the decent riding regular heel side and when it comes to where I should and could be making a turn to continue toe side regular, end up just “falling leaf’ing” it and going goofy heel side. 

I just can’t seem to turn the tail of the board quick enough in tighter areas to continue riding regular.

I somehow think perhaps in this situation my board may be some of the issue(perhaps too long?) 
It’s a 99%twin and my bindings are set up as such if that may also be affecting my turn abilities?

Your never to old to shred.,"I have a quick story to tell. 
My dad used to be a skier for 20 + years. When I was young he started me on two planks, and I hated it. Later that day, I switched my rental to a snowboard, and fell in love. 
Reluctantly, my dad switched as well. He bought an old gnu for 40 bucks from his friend and began those endless bunny hill runs with me. He was 46 at the time.
For the next 11 years (and still today) he would drive the 2 hour trip to hit 400 feet of vertical over 450 times. He taught us to ride fast, he took us to the park for the first time, and told us endless stories of when he skied in powder in Colorado, something I still haven’t experienced. Now, as a 16 year old, I can’t help but notice how much people use age as a barrier. My dad is 57. 
He just learned methods and board slides. 
He’s thrown his back out 3 times and broken his arm, and still continues to go to the mountain, even though he no longer needs to drive us. For him, it’s not a chore. He shares the same love as all of us.

TNFDryvent 2L vs Gore-Tex,"TLDR; Northface Dryvent or Gore-Tex long term review?


After a bit of feedback here on the gear side of things-

Picked up a pair of The North Face Freedom Pants at what I am considering be an absolute steal ($100CAD brand new)

They were final stock so grabbed them before actually researching them thoroughly BUT I can return them.

The only snowboard pants I’ve owned before these were INOC ‘Snowboard’ pants from Aldi Australia, which for the price and for my first couple of seasons learning have actually been amazing.
Uninsulated (which I prefer) and surprisingly waterproof but now after my first season ass-sliding, the seat is beginning to wear through and I get a wet butt every time I chair.
The rest of the pants keep me bone dry.

So, back to my point-

Does anyone have some long term feedback on North Faces 2L Dryvent Gear? 
I’m a bit of a stickler for making things worth my money and lasting so I don’t want to be buying a new pair in a season or twos time because they are no longer waterproof or have worn through.

There’s not much other choice out there that fits my bill of being lightly insulated, yet waterproof in the sub &lt;$150 price range.

Long term- will I be happy with 2L Dryvent, or should I cough up a little extra coin for something with genuine Gore-Tex?

If it matters- Male and I run super hot when riding (hence minimal/no insulation) with nothing but boxers underneath riding Vancouver local mountains, regardless of temp.
On a colder than average day, or a Whistler or Revelstoke trip, I simply wear long ‘Skins’ compression pants underneath my current Aldi pants.",snowboarding,1578365406,dwarfmarine13,True,2020-01-06,0

Board too short or board too tall?,"Having a really hard time finding a board to fit out 5 years old. 

Stats:

* About 34"" / 85cm to his chin
* Maybe 32-33"" to his shoulders
* Current board is listed as 80cm but measures about 30.5"" / 77cm
* All boards locally are 100cm and larger.

So, we can either use his too small board or get a too big board. It's a slightly smaller gap between ""correct"" size of 85cm (or a bit less) and his current around 77cm. A 100cm board would be near the top of his head. Feel like I've answered my own question and will just stick with his current board unless we can find a 90cm by some miracle but thought I'd throw the question out there.",snowboarding,1578371391,guesswhochickenpoo,True,2020-01-06,0

got a gopro max. how do i mount it for the floating behind myself follow cam?,"im sorry for trying this again mods, but i dunno what was wrong with the question. I have no idea how reddit works so just lmk if this isn't allowed...? I can add a video if y'all want? human GoPro Fetch 

Anyways, I'm trying to make some sickass solo park edits with that view.. so need somethin thats stable and wont break off or impale me if i fall.... preferably....

And just to be clear, I'm talkin about the vids where its above and behind, you have full view of the rider from feet to head, can clearly see what he's doing etc. I think the Rylo cam was supposed to be specifically designed for this type of shot (maybe? idk). Also see a lot of vids from Insta360 like this.

I'm really working on my content, and well I have the normal selfie stick mini tripod deal for filming with friends, but and ride alone a lot, so trying to figure out better ways to do this, which is why I thought I'd give this camera a shot. Helmet/chest cam footage is honestly super fucking weak, and Tripods are nice but you can only do so much with that. And I don't like leaving my tripod on a 40 foot + jump cuz I'm not hiking back up that shit.

So I'm HOPING I can buy or build some kind of mount that would work for me. It needs to not cause me an injury, because lets be real I fall a lot lol. And if I'm going inverted and it smacks against the ground it would be great if it doesn't snap in half. And the movements are obviously pretty jarring when landing big airs and tbh even jibbing, so the mount needs to hold steady ish reasonably well I think?

Is this realistic? I hope so, cuz well I own it already lol

Also, as a side question, if you smacked the gopro max against a snowboard rail in a fall, is it gonna break? As far as I can see ppl don't usually use cases?

I'm obviously very new to GoPros, and looking to step up my vid edits from cell phone footy and my homies Hero3 to create leggggggiiit as footy ay?? Appreciate any and all advice thanks!",snowboarding,1578396556,SaintNegligence,True,2020-01-07,0

I'm a huge fan of taking care of my sporting equipment as much as possible.

I've noticed in the past that the underside of my snowboard gets this whiteness to it. They told me that it's dry and needs waxing.

So I waxed my snowboard for the first time. And then the next day I actually went snowboarding. It was shocking how ""slippery"" my snowboard was on the snow. Like never before. Makes me wonder how they waxed it before if at all? It was so slick that getting off the lift with only one foot clipped it, it really wanted to slide out. It was extremely noticeable. I'm assuming that's a good thing...

Anyways, after a single snowboarding session (although a little on the icy side) I noticed this dry whiteness on the bottom of my board again. It was only like a 3 hour session.

Is this normal? Do you usually wax after every snowboarding session?? Or is my board and/or riding style just not great at retaining a wax?

Rides [website](https://ridesnowboards.com/en-us/p/warpig-snowboard) says sizing goes by weight but on the questions section of the board and on all YouTube videos they say to downsize what you normally ride by 6-10cm because the warpig is a volume shifted snowboard and is much wider than a traditional board. I would catorgize myself as a freestyle rider who loves to shred pow and dip and dive through the trees and also be a little speed demon on the grommers with small amounts of park thrown in.

I am slightly over 6 feet tall, weighing in at \~180lbs and have been riding a 156cm Option board for the past 11 years.

Rides website sizing by weight is;

S =  100-175lbs, 148cm

M =  130-190lbs, 151cm

L =  140-200lbs,  154cm

So by weight I should get a Medium sized board but if downsizing by 6-10cm I should get something between 146-150cm which would put me at a Small. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",snowboarding,1578489664,temptationsDie,True,2020-01-08,0

"Snowboard protection, D3O vs other materials.","This year I want to start practicing stuff in the park. And as a beginner, it seems like a good idea to get some protective gear; back protector, crash pants, etc. 

So I have been researching what would be the best stuff to buy. And one thing that frequently pops up on the internet is this new 'D3O material'. 

This sounds cool and futuristic, and I am tempted to buy some. But I have read some reviews on amazon that the stuff is actually not that great. My main concern that it goes hard on impact, thus acts like a hard piece of plastic, which doesn't sound as comfortable as landing on some type of cushioning material. For example, I can imagine that falling on your butt on a box is more comfortable with some cushioning in between you and the box, than with a hard piece of plastic in between you and the box.

Is this the case, and should I look for different materials? Or should I go for the D3O stuff? Or does it depend on the location of the protection?",snowboarding,1577657279,TombaTof,True,2019-12-29,0

Guys please I’m in dire need of advice. I got in an accident and got off with a bruise but the other person tore her ACL.,"I was up boarding at Cypress and on Collins, I caught my edge and smashed into a skier. The first thing I asked was “u good?” and she said “not really” and I thought “oh piss”. But I stuck around with her till she was well enough to stand. 

Small digression - we end up talking for a while and end up having a good convo. Minus the whole “hope you’re not injured” and me apologizing all the time, I’d say we were kinda vibing and she asked to add me on FB. 

Ski Patrol arrived and said we should exchange numbers and names in case. She could stand in about half an hour but was too fucked to ski down so she waited for a snow mobile. 

She hits me up today cuz apparently she tore her ACL. I’m f***ing terrified that now I’m going to have to pony up for her surgery and I’m dead poor. My parents aren’t super well to do and I scrimped together every last penny from my job at McDonalds to pay for my season pass and gear.

I'm looking at getting my first board, I have gone boarding a few times now and love it. I originally was looking at getting a GNU Money or GNU Carbon Credit but I just don't like the looks of the money (unfortunately) and the Carbon Credit maybe seems like I would outgrow it quick.

So I kept looking and now I'm starting to lean towards one of the following:

1. The Burton Process Flying V (I am in midwest though so has been icy / hard pack a few times when I have gone and from what I have read the flying V can be loose)
2. Jones Frontier
3. Capita Outerspace Living
4. K2 Raygun

Mainly just groomers, carving and putzing around the mountain, not looking to hit any jumps for a long time but I would like to try getting into maybe some butters or things like that.

Day 2 in to a snowboarding holiday and had my confidence knocked and now too scared to board.,"So, first time on an actual piste/mountain. Before this it was all indoor snow slopes, which I've been doing for years. I can board on both edges, link my c turns etc...

Today on the slopes, I just couldn't go from heel to toe edge. My body would get extreme fear the second I levelled out and would never commit round to being on the toe. So I just kinda awkwardly used one edge which wore my muscles out after just one run. I'm terrified of how much speed I pick up as I level out and when I try to swap edge, I feel it bite the snow and it trips me over hard.

Weirdly yesterday I was fine but I got over confident and bit it hard - think I bruised a rib. I think this is the fear that's stopping me committing to the turn as I don't want to fall again as it hurts a lot to get up. 

I also don't seem to be able to follow the route very well, I'm trying to turn right to follow the piste but I'm constantly drifting left. I end up in spots with not enough speed to climb and find myself having to unclip my board and walk to an edge. 

It's like I've forgotten everything, how to turn, how to toe edge, how to link turns, etc... I was wondering if any other rookies popping their cherry had been through similar and had some advice. Thanks.",snowboarding,1577817861,JustAnEnglishBloke,True,2019-12-31,0

Ollies and nollies,"This season is my fourth season of riding and I just recently bought a 2020 Ride Twinpig. After a lot of cruising last season, I felt like I got to a point where my riding was pretty confident on all the runs I was doing and that I wanted to get into the park and learn some tricks. All I've really done in the past is 50/50 boxes and small jumps, nothing crazy but this season I wanna step it up and learn some basic tricks (FS/BS 180s, basic butters, BS boardslide on a box). 

After getting the Twinpig I've noticed a few differences compared to my previous board. I expected to see this as the board I had before was a lot shorter and skinny and the Twinpig is a pretty wide board, but I don't know how much this has to do with the size of them. Getting pop on my ollies now seems more difficult on the new board which surprised me a bit. I am mainly confused because of how easy nollies feel with how much pop I can get with ease. Also going switch and doing an ollie feels much easier like that end of the board has more pop in it. 

Has anyone else experienced this, or is this just normal and I am stupid? I am going to keep practicing my ollies on this board, but it just seems a little strange that I am doing nollies with so much ease but struggling to find my flow with ollies, almost like it would make sense for the board to be set up the other way.

Snowboard lessons are holding back the sport,"I've been around reddit long enough to know that this will get downvoted to Bolivia, but I've got to put it out there anyway: **beginner lessons are holding back snowboarding**. I think this is the main reason why there are fewer people snowboarding today than there were back before the sport was mainstream. 

I learned to ride in the mid-90's and I've heard from other boarders that beginner lessons were a thing back then, but I wasn't aware of them and no one I rode with back in the 90's had ever taken a lesson. Basically had a bunch of skateboarders and ex-skiers who took a board up onto the hill and after the first day they either gave up or learned to link turns comfortably.

Fast foward 25 years, and I'm teaching my nephew how to ski (I told him when he can make parallel turns on blue trails he can switch). I was shocked at what I saw from the snowboarders at the magic carpet.

 * One young couple was teaching their son to ride. He was about 3 and on a board with a leash. His parents never attempted to teach him edging or speed control. The dad held the leash tight to control his speed and the mom would spread her legs and say ""knuckle dragger!"" and he would crouch down and go between her legs. I was thinking ""God bless those two, they have a million times the patience I do. Are they really going to give up 5+ years of their prime riding years playing pointless games with their son?"" But after an hour they disappeared. Perhaps they handed their kid off to a grandparent.

 * A woman was teaching her boyfriend to ride by holding his hands as he attempted to turn. He caught a bunch of toeside edges and ultimately ski patrol had to take him down the mountain in a stretcher. I think he broke an ankle.

 * Another kid was being taught and basically making falling leaf turns on his heelside edge. I never saw him on his toeside edge.

 * One older snowboard instructor was teaching a young man and he was slowly making progress with gentle linked toe and heelside edges. Still, I was struck by the fact that it's like learning to ride a bike while going at a walking pace. It's just hard without a bit more speed and momentum to flex your board.

 * Meanwhile the skiers were generally progressing in a more or less linear fashion doing pizza and french fries. 

 I know that many older generation snowboarders have since taught our kids skiing, with the possibility of switching as they get older. We ourselves learned as teenagers who basically had adult-level coordination, strength and confidence. We collectively realized that learning to ride as a kid is very difficult except for exceptional athletes.

So here are my conclusions:

 * Even the ski community is unreasonably enthusiastic about lessons. Even level 3 Ski instructors are not like tennis or golf pros who can generally wipe the floor with the club champion, and have taken extensive certification courses in teaching. And keep in mind that most instructors that teach beginners are not even level 1 certified. I worked briefly as a ski instructor and found out very quickly that my job was not to teach kids how to ski, but to babysit the kids while mom and dad skied on their own. By contrast, when parents send their kids to the tennis or golf pro, they are hoping their kids will be great junior golfers or tennis players.

 * About 90% of the population aged 5 to 65 can learn to ski, but snowboarding is harder to learn and the percentage is lower. People may have given up in the 90's because they fell a lot, but people today are quitting in higher numbers because they aren't getting any positive sense of progress at all. They spend an hour or two on the bunny slope and watch the beginning skiers make steady progress. I think this probably the most important point. **Snowboard lessons are based on the not-so-Noble Lie that virtually everyone can learn to snowboard if they follow a gentle enough progression. But instead this gentle progression is useless for people who are not athletic enough to snowboard, and frustrating for people who are.**

 * Snowboarders don't have pizza and french fries. They have to go immediately to linking parallel turns, and that requires balancing on a single edge. Much like riding a bike, you are more stable with at least a little speed because changes in edge pressure are used to center your balance. At lower speeds those changes are smaller and slower to develop so it takes better balance to ride at slow speeds than moderate speeds. Moreover, linking turns benefits from flexing the board, and even if beginner boards are flexed for magic carpets (and I doubt they are), a board that soft won't provide much energy. Snowboarders need a steeper bunny slope than skiers to make good progress.",snowboarding,1577980068,WallLearner,True,2020-01-02,0
Always feels like I'm going to wipe out doing nose press,"I'm learning to do nose and tail presses to eventually lead into more complex tricks. While I feel comfortable doing tail presses (they seem less risky because the worst thing that can happen is you sit on your butt), nose presses have been hard to learn. When I do a nose press, it feels like I'm going to face plant into the snow. I don't feel comfortable trying it on a steep hill (blue or black) at all.

Riding a board from 2007. How much have boards changed/improved in the last decade?,"I live in the Midwest and ride 5-15 days a year. I bought a Burton custom X in 2007 and it's still in good condition. I do my own waxing/edges and except for a few rock gouges that I've repaired it's in great condition. I don't have any complaints with the board but I also don't know what I'm missing with newer boards. 

I'm an all mountain rider but my favorite conditions are high speeds groomed blues or powder when its available. I'll do small/medium kickers and tabletops but I'd much rather be linking higher speed turns. 

Do boards wear out? I've probably got 50-75 days of use accumulated on this board/binding combo. (boots are newer Nike)

Edge Maintenance,"Hey so I’m trying to expand my board maintenance skills this year beyond waxing.

Need to reset this hobby after 20 long years,"Im in my mid 30s, and embarassed to say that I never really got decent at snowboarding and I've been doing it for about 2 decades now. I went a ton in high school and college but just fell out of it due to I believe having just the incorrect equipment.

About 5 years ago, I purchased a burton custom. At the time I was a big boy and since I had money to now burn a bit (being a grown-up and all now), I said fuck it and decided it was time to replace the gear I had been using in high school. Being the practical person I am, I went and looking at snowboard sizing guides, and since I was 6'0 240lbs at the time, but a 169 wide. Even though I was morbidly obese at the time, I still worked out regularly and was relatively fit... at least for someone overweight. Sure enough, I'm constantly catching edges riding the blue squares or what have you in Tahoe.

Fast forward five years later, and I get my usual winter melancholy feelings; thinking about the days in the past where I had all my gusto and not giving a shit about getting hurt.

Anyways, getting to my point: What would be the best way to get this hobby started again. I have the income to do it and logistics aren't a problem either. I'd like to stick with Burton's because of the channel system and not wanting to get new bindings again. Also, now, I'm a nice and fit 190lbs (still the same height though). Boots are 11's.

Because my school schedule is more open this upcoming semester i'll have more time for the gym and sports. I expect to remain between 150 and 155 but i might drop down to 145 due to training for a race.

I have a question regarding the new Kessler Spectra. I ride a Cross for carving days and BX and The Ride for all-Mountain days.

I used to ride way back in the day, around 2009. 

I recently moved up to Anchorage, Alaska and was considering getting back into riding. 

My setup:
Sims 150 Vector Series snowboard 

Morrow dimension bindings

Vans Encore Pro Boa boots. 

As far as I can tell, there’s some superficial damage on the top of the bird (scratches and such). The edges need to be looked at, and it needs a waxing badly. 

Is this setup still usable, or would I be better off looking to buy new equipment?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated 😁",snowboarding,1577509585,oryeo213,True,2019-12-28,0

Powder/Carving Board for Japan/Nagano and Australia,"Okey dokey.  


\-I did a season at Thredbo this year on a soft camrock twin (Wired Directive). It was not good for Thredbo. This will be the park board.  
\-I'm about to go to Japan to do 3 weeks in Hakuba and 1 week in Madaro.  


\-I would say I'm a solid intermediate at this point.  


\-178cm/5'10""  
\-US 9.5 Boot  
\-Currently 74kg/165 pounds but usually range between 75-80 (165 and 175)  
\-Cartel Bindings

I want something that's gonna be killer fun/easy in the Japow and killer fun for carving too. I also want something that I know is gonna be good shit in Aus when things get icy. I really love charging hard and fast too - which I recognise favours longer stiffer boards and the shorter/fatter/softer thing is better for tree runs. I had a really shit time trying to carve my board in Aus this year which I think partially comes down to the rocker in the ends, softness, maybe width, and maybe lack of edge tech.  


Boards I've been looking at (and are available at my local shop right now which will save me 10% now and 10% taking it overseas:  


Nitro Squash  
Yes the Y  
Flight Attendant  
Skeleton Key (sorta)  


I picked up the Squash 159 but I'm not fully sold on it yet.I'm half expecting myself (and the guys in the shop) to go back and pick up the Y. Also I don't know if I should've gone shorter on the Squash, it isn't really clear from searching the web and they only list minimum weights on the website  


I think the thing that pushed me to grab the Squash was that I thought maybe the wider width of the Y/slower turns would bother me and that maybe it wouldn't hold up so well when charging harder and faster - and I wanted something with some half decent camber.   


I do however feel like the Y might be a better board for tree runs, better for grip in hard/icy snow and potentially an easier transition out of riding the board I have. It's really hard to know if you're biting off more than you can chew with a new board, which is also why I didn't grab the Flight Attendant or Skeleton Key.  


I'll be going to Hakuba first, so if I need to, I can grab gear over there, but it will be more expensive, so I'd like to believe it'd be worth the difference.  


Also, advice on pants/bibs/jackets for someone going to Japan who has some squat thiccness.

Burton step on review - 2 days with them.,"Long story short, they’re worth it. 


There’s a lot of pros with them and very few cons. The first pro is how simple the system is to use. You just step on it, make sure you get 2 clicks deep with your heel, then click in the 2 side toe cleats. I managed to practice getting my back foot clicked the second I get off the lift. This is very useful to me as a solo rider. I just click in off the lift and go on my run. The second pro is just how connected you feel to the board. The click in system makes it so that your boot is attached from 3 sides extremely tight. There is basically no leeway for movement between the connection points of the binding to the boot. Unlike straps where there’s movement even if you strapped it super tight, with the step ones, you transfer power from the feet to the board very efficiently. It’s instantaneous when you start to engage a toe side carve and also a heel side carve. They never feel like they’re gonna fall off. 


One con I noticed was when you aren’t able to click your back foot in off the lift, if you’re on a slope it could be a little harder to click in. Not a deal breaker because you just sit down and press your board against your boots. Another con depending on your financial situation is the cost of the system. The bindings are $250 and the boots I got, the photons, were $400. So $650 for the whole set. 


Other than that, I’m in love with the system, and I don’t see myself going back to strap in bindings, even if you gave me the best pair on the market for free.",snowboarding,1577556749,warm_and_sunny,True,2019-12-28,0

Skateboarding + Skiing = Snowboarding??,"Hey guys! Skier and skateboarder here. I've grown up skiing, but stopped around the middle of high school. This is my fourth year of college, and I've picked it up again. It's been really fun getting out onto the slopes and enjoying the snow. However, while looking for equipment, I've realized that skis and boots tend to cost more than snowboards and boots. Not to mention how uncomfortable ski boots are. I've also picked up skateboarding last summer, and realized how a lot of my skater friends snowboard during the winter. Because of this, I've been entertaining the idea of defecting to snowboarding as a winter sport. 

I can ride my skateboard fairly well. I can frontside and backside powerslide on a skateboard, ollie and nollie, and do other simple tricks such as 180s, heelflips, manuals, or small 50-50s. (working on my FS 360s and kickflips) On a pair of skis, I can carve fairly well and can ski in variable snow conditions (groomers, moguls, trees) and fairly difficult runs. I'm not the greatest at either sport, but I really enjoy progressing in both.

First timer going to Pennsylvania this weekend! Concerned about my apparel,"Hi all, this saturday I am going snowboarding for the first time. I’m going with friends I rented a house with for the weekend. I am just concerned on if what I wear will be good enough for the cold temperatures that are supposed to come. It’s going to be 20 degree weather when we go, so I just want to make sure I am prepared clothing-wise. 

I plan on wearing long johns and a pair of basketball shorts underneath a pair of sweatpants, with snow pants over it all. For my upper body, I am wearing a tank top undershirt, a tee shirt, a long sleeve thermal, and a hood less crewneck sweater, covered by a typical champion windbreaker. I’m not concerned about my lower body as much as my upper body. I do not own any large winter jackets to wear in place of the windbreaker, but with my layering in mind, do you think I will be okay? We realistically only plan on being on the hill for 2-4 hours max.

Where to buy affordable snowboard set for beginner - Niseko or Mercari?,"Hi everyone,

I'm a total beginner at snowboarding (I've only started early this year and done it 3 times) but enjoyed it so much that I decided to head to Niseko this coming January for a month.

I will be working part-time in a restaurant in Grand Hirafu and plan to hit the slopes every day, so I believe buying my own gears would work out better than renting them. Since I'm still starting out and not doing anything hardcore, I want to keep my budget as low as possible.

My question is: Can I find any second-hand shops in Niseko with cheap snowboarding gears, or are they mainly catered to seasoned snowboarders, selling high-end equipment? I've done a quick search and found some second-hand ones on mercari (メルカリ local sell-buy app), ranging from 10,000 to 30,000 jpy. Again, I'm a noob so I think it would be better if I could pick them out at a shop, but what would you guys advice?

Thanks!!

Ps/ I'm currently living in Nagoya, so I also have the option to get my gears at a local shop.

Also sorry for posting on multiple threads!",snowboarding,1576819947,crispsfats,True,2019-12-20,0

Could you guys answer some questions? I'm thinking of buying my second snowboard and want to make sure everything's right.,"1: I'm currently riding a beginner board in size 150 (burton ripcord) and the board i'm considering most (burton kilroy twin) doesn't exist in size 150 but it does in 152 and 148. Which size should i choose, i'm 175 tall.

1: The snowboard i'm thinking of buying (burton kilroy) is mainly for park but also usable for all mountain and has a medium - light flex. Would that work well for casual all-mountain as well as for learning park?

What snowboard should I buy as a gift for my fiancé?,"I don’t know if this is the right place to post but I want to get my fiancé a snowboard for Christmas and I have no idea where to start. I don’t ski or snowboard and I clearly haven’t listened over the past 10 years of him talking about it so I’m clueless. 

He currently has a 2012 (I think??) Technine Icon Bob Marley board. It’s pretty beat up and his stoner days are behind him so I’d like to get him something with a more streamlined look. 

No idea how the sizing for boards works but he loves that board so I’d like to get something similar. I think sizing has something to do with height? He’s around 6’2”. He rides mostly in New England and bitches about icy trails a lot, so something that could handle that would be good I think (is that a thing??). I’d like to keep it under $500.

Need help with burton custom channel &amp; union bindings. m6 channel inserts not fitting properly,"I bought a used burton custom last season (my first time buying a board) and I'm looking to replace the beat up bindings with new union bindings. 

After I got my union bindings, I found out that the old channel inserts doesn't work with the union discs. No biggie, I went and bought a Burton M6 channel inserts and mounting set. 

However, I now find that the channel inserts doesn't fit in the channel. Please see pictures below.

The silver insert is the old insert and the black one is the M6 channel insert. You can see that the M6 insert doesn't fit properly and is wider than the silver insert.

Any help appreciated so that I can get these new union bindings on. Thank you!",snowboarding,1577055602,balilewis,True,2019-12-22,0

Recommend me an all-mountain board,"So looking for a new board this season and would love to hear some recommendations from the community. Break down below:

**About Me**

* Advanced all-mountain rider
* Older rider so park days are far behind me
* Terrain wise like ungroomed runs, powder, tree runs, steeps, mellow all-mountain hits and carves, and some side country (from resort)

**Ideal Board**

* All-mountain
* Lean towards being better daily driver that would do well in powder and not concerned with park
* Would prefer something little playful and less super stiff
* Coming off a flat-rocker board and would prefer something little more on the forgiving side than full camber 
* Home base: PNW

**Some boards that I've been researching:**

Avoid RIDE if you want any part support.,"Last year I purchased a new board and bindings, I was stocked about the warpig and ended up getting talked into the LTD bindings. Early this season one of my binding straps broke. On December 2nd I contacted Ride about getting a replacement part for my bindings. I have yet to recieve the part, and after talking with customer service about the problem on four different occasions they still have not fixed the problem. Their estimated time to get me a replacement part is the beginning of January. On top of this when I called around to local shops there is nobody within 150 miles of me that has that part in stock! I have contacted over 50 places and nobody has it. The kicker of all of this is when I asked the customer service why I shouldnt be pissed their response was ""we provide you with replacement parts for free"".  I'd rather spend $20 and have a month of my season back! I will never go with Ride again, and I would warn anyone else against buying from them as well.

The Powder Mantra,"Ok guys, so I got a little story to tell. This is my 4th year into this beautiful, amazing sport. I was hooked at my first turn, I am obsessed, when the season comes, I can’t think of anything else. 
When I’m out there, in the mountains, I don’t really have breaks, I just can’t stop, can’t wait to make my next turn. 

Only one Issue, I live in this absolutely mesmerizing country, with all the mountains you need, except glaciers. It’s called Romania, only issue, our resorts are small and crowded, except for two, but you eventually get bored of the same terrain which is not that vast. 

I had to do something, luckily enough, Austrian alps are not that far away. I went there 6 times so far. The first time, I kinda had some shitty weather.

So from there on, I came up with this mantra, that says:

“God of snow, please give us the weather we need not the one we deserve”. 

So I repeat that, every time I plan a trip to the alps, where I get 7 days of amazing resorts. 

I have to tell you, the last 5 times, it was powder and bluebird galore. 

Now I wonder, am I the luckiest motherfucker in the world or this really works. 







tl;dr: I use this mantra to have powder on my snowboarding trips. “God of snow, please give us the weather we need not the one we deserve”",snowboarding,1577201713,TinyTheBig,True,2019-12-24,0

Hit my first box and black diamond yesterday,"Yesterday was pretty crazy for me. I went to Northstar and there was an unpredicted storm that brought in over a foot of powder that just wouldn’t stop coming. I met two cool guys on the mountain when they overheard me asking an employee where the workbench is;  they let me use their screwdriver and we shredded together for the day. I spent a lot of time in the unmarked paths through the trees shredding an incredible amount of powder and even hitting a few jumps along the way. I ate a lot of shit and ran into a few trees, one of which sent me on 3 cartwheel tumble and left me buried in powder. I worked up the courage to hit the park and successfully rode one of the boxes. I accidentally made a wrong turn into a black diamond, but I chilled there for a minute watching other people until I worked up the courage to do it myself.  I changed my stance to a lower squatting position and immediately noticed a huge improvement in my control and balance capabilities. And at the end of the day I got some free chili and beer. Such a fun day, my entire body aches, but was worth it!

I’d like to tack on a few questions: 

1. I noticed that I was consistently catching the edge near my back heel, how can I fix this?

2. I tend to lean on my back foot more than my front. It helps me tackle the bumps, but I lose my balance on jumps easily and my back leg ends much more sore at the end of the day. How can I improve this?",snowboarding,1577215744,LieutenantCheeze,True,2019-12-24,0

I got a 156 Salomon Assassin and I've old Burton Mission bindings. I was looking into getting a new pair of boots and maybe replacing the bindings. With my budgets this would be the options.
For boots: Aura Pro, Burton Ruler or Burton Imperial
For findings: brand new Burton Mission, Union Force or Burton Cartel (re:flex)
I have a 40% off Burton and 20% Vans and Union.
Which option do you think would work best? All I want to do is ride the whole mountain, hitting side kicks and natural features, ride a bit in between trees and off piste. Not really looking into going to the park.",snowboarding,1577222912,3rdwrldthug,True,2019-12-24,0

Board recommendation plz!,"I'm thinking of getting a new board and havent been following the new boards or tech for 6 years or so and I could use some help.

I get out about 20+ days a year to the resort in northern az and ride all the big storms. I'm 5'10"" and maybe 150lb.

I'm looking for a board that's good in pow but not pow specific. Like I could take it out and have fun on any nice day but take riding pow to another level and let me ride the tight trees I cant with my other boards.

Been looking at Jones Mind Expander and hovercraft but dont know if they're too pow specific or even where else to look.

 I currently have a  157 Lib tech Trs from 2012 and 154 forum that's pure rocker. Both boards are fun on good days, but not so much on super hard pack and I gotta really work in the powder.

Love Powder and Backcountry/off groomer runs, need to be able to shred groomers. Usable in a terrain park would be nice but unnecessary.

Been out of the game for a while. Need some good advice,"I picked up snowboarding about 8 years ago but lately I have not been able to go much. I've been having some pain in my outside front foot when I DO go, I feel that I put too much effort and focus in staying up rather than just enjoying it, and after some research I've realized I've had my stance all wrong (too wide, bad angles, too much setback). I'm hoping to fix these things this season.

Here's what I'm hoping to know - if I put in some time this season to try and get better, how should I do that? My main goals are (1) getting overall better so that I can ride a little more effortlessly and (2) learn to ride switch.

Unfortunately I still don't have a lot of time to commit to snowboarding and I'm going to be changing up everything about my bindings/stance. I'm thinking a more narrow stance, a barely front-facing angle, and no setback. And with my limited time, I'm hoping to commit to one of my two boards off the bat:

Burton Joystick 2012 - 161 cm - rocker
Burton Custom 2010 - 158w - standard camber

I'm 6'3"" and 190 pounds without my gear. I'll be riding in the Northeast US, mostly hard packed, groomers, and ice. Given my goals above, which board would be better to commit to?

The death of Parking lot “A” at Crystal Mountain WA,"The death of parking lot “A”

I’m fucking pissed. Crystal announced today that starting the 21st of Dec, “A” lot will be reserved for cars of 4 people or more 7 days a week. If your a crystal regular like me, then you know that “A” lot is usually half empty on week days. It’s also part of the fun to get up early to get those coveted “A” lot spots on the busier days. Apparently if I show up with less than 4 people in my car, despite’s how empty A lot is, I will be told to park elsewhere.   

What. The. Fuck.

I am NOT happy with what Alterra is doing to crystal. First opening then closing the mountain, then opening again. They could have kept the base open for the first week, but didn’t because they wanted to preserve the snow for the weekend crowd. Next they could have opened the top last Friday (bluebird pow), but once again chose to save it for the weekend crowd. They also took some people up to the top Friday to shoot a promo video showing two people skiing through the powder. Elitist. Old crystal would never have done that. Feels like they want to turn us into Vail or something.

Reviving old Switch bindings,"# Background

Switch snowboard bindings were the greatest snowboard bindings ever made (don't @ me)

Due in part to worse profit margins and in part to successful negative marketing campaigns against them, they stopped being produced many years ago. The bindings are made of steel and will basically last forever, however the outlook for the boots is not as rosy.

Even unused boots produced 15+ years ago are beginning to fall apart as the rubber and composite materials simply break down over time. And of course if you're using the boots, wear &amp; tear can damage the stitching and plastic components (especially the ratchets).

# Ideas

I've been dreaming of having new Switch-compatible boots fabricated using Alibaba or something like it.

Or possibly retrofitting a standard pair of new snowboarding boots by screwing the plate on, but my concern with that is that standard snowboarding boots are not rigid enough to work, and there is likely a need for something solid to screw the binding plate *into* in the boot.

Which brings me to my next idea—what if I bought a pair of Burton's new step on boots and screwed the Switch plate into those? Seems like those boots would have the required rigidity and solid footbed to attach the plate to. Obviously I'm a bit nervous about the integrity of that connection (plate-to-boot).

I'm going to investigate this further, if I can find a pair of Burton Step-On bindings to examine in person. Or I might buy a pair of their boots &amp; bindings and if I don't like their system, return the bindings and try to retrofit the boots.

But my question to you folks is this: has anyone out there tried something like this? Ideally with success?

Thanks!

Boa boots causing numb toes,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been snowboarding for about 4 seasons now and have always worn traditional lace up boots and while my feet often got sore from running down a hill, they would always recover when I had a chance to sit down and never felt numb. However this season I've decided to demo some boots and have tried the Burton Ruler BOA and the Salomon Faction BOA and both make my foot go numb after about 10 minutes of wear and I need to take them off after every run. I've tried both a size 8 and a size 10 in them (hoping to try a 9 tomorrow) to see if this resolved the issue but it sadly has not. I believe it might be because I have quite a wide foot so it is tightening down the bottom too much in order to tighten the top to the right level.

Is this normal for single-BOA style boots? Unfortunately the rental shop does not have any traditional lace boots available but they do have Burton Ruler's with the speedlace system, would this perhaps imitate closer to real laces?",snowboarding,1575940399,Ausexchange,True,2019-12-09,0

Looking for a new board - overwhelmed with the options!,"Hi All,

I've been doing some googling and research on this sub, but am a bit overwhelmed with what type of board to get next.

I'm 5'10, 160 lbs, and bootsize is 9. I'm currently riding a Burton Process (from 2015?) at 159 cm. I used to be a bit over 200 lbs so I was recommended a long board. now that I have 5 seasons under my belt of 15+ days, I feel very comfortbale on a board and would like to try somethign shorter.

I'm looking for an all mountain board since I don't just do one thing. I'm usually doing runs with friends who aren't as experienced/fun, so I like to have a mix of being able to bomb runs, but also being able to do trees. As for park, I have about 2 seasons worth of experience with it, so feel comfortable with jumps and easy boxes/rails. Would like to continue to work on it and get better at riding switch.

When I spoke with a board shop owner last year, he recommended me to go down to at least 156, potentially even down to 153-154. Noting that I would feel way ""freer"" with what I can do on the mountains.

I know that I should most likely demo a few boards, but it would be nice to be able to just get something new before I start my trips so I can get comfortable on it. I almost feel like have a shorter and more flexible board is a bigger priority than trying out a bunch of different onces, where I may not be able to even tell a huge difference.

I'd like to stay under $400 if possible, but can go up to $500 if there's something THAT much better for a bit more. A few models that have popped up a lot include:

 - NS Proto 2
 - Capita DOA
 - Ride Warpig
 - lib tech TRS
 - arbor westmark


Would love to hear people's recommendations on both board length, as well as model! I definitely don't have any issues with my current board, but am very curious to get a shorter one so that I can get a different experience.",snowboarding,1576001828,dzhou10,True,2019-12-10,0

My question is this: She is 130lbs, 5ft8in. Is a 149cm women's board too small? Is she better off with 150+?

She will be riding a mix of groomed/powder/park.

&amp;#x200B;

Ache on outside of front foot.,"I know these kinds of posts litter a multitude of snowboarding forums, but I my specifics are a bit different than those that I have read, so I'd like to get some feed back specific to my issue.

First, i have had this since I started riding about 4 years ago.  Some days, its not so bad, some days, I get it first run.  The pain in ONLY on the outside edge of my front foot (left).   I don't ride switch yet, so I can't say if I feel it in the switch position.  Last weekend was my first run of the season, and I got the pain halfway down the first run.  Last year, i felt it the beginning of the season, but took a lesson, and it seems it largely went away for the remainder of the season.

I feel this issue is due to technique, rather than boots, bindings, or stance width.... especially since after my lesson (this lesson we focused on confidence in speeding down the hill,) the pain was mostly a memory.

Any ideas I can try to isolate where the problem is?  I'm thinking of the following:

1.  Widening my stance.
2. Renting different boots/bindings, if that is even possible.",snowboarding,1576179038,SlitherXO,True,2019-12-12,0

Time out added to lift gates @ local spot. WHY?,"Our local spot has a point system along with season/day passes.

This season they decided to add a 6 minute lock out after each swipe. One goes through then 6 minutes has to elapse before the next can enter. Normally there's 3-4 of us.

Final Board Choice Advice,"Alright, I have done a ton of research on boards and have finally narrowed it down to my top three. Looking to get some final input. 

Riding/board wants - I'm on the east coast now and will be spending most of my time on grooms and parks (looking to focus this year more on trails and jumps), but love some POW runs if they are available as well as some trees. Because of that I really need a well versed all mountain board. Currently have the burton bullet 164W for super POW days. I'm 6'7 240 pounds size 13 boot so I will be riding a W. 

Top three boards not in any particular ranking and my research conclusions below. Any feedback and input on what may be best for my wants would be appreciated. 

- Capita super DOA - this board looks like a great all mountain but more focus on the park and freestyle play. 

- Burton deep thinker - this board obviously does well in POW but still has some playfulness and a lot of reviews says it is still fun in the park. 

- Burton free thinker - better for park than the deep thinker by stats but loses the edge in being able to handle powder.

Getting to shred again soon and need advice,"What's up guys! Sorry in advance if this post is a little wordy.

So, next week I get to go to Brian Head Utah! It's one of my favorite resorts and definitely the one I'm most comfortable on. I've lived in Georgia my whole life so as you can guess - shredding has been pretty sporadic for me :(. My current level is I can ride any blue very easily and most blacks fairly well. I do love trail riding but I also typically hit up the park on my runs down. I can hit boxes easily and do grabs off jumps pretty well. Here's my predicament: I wanna be able to hit rails on most runs through the park. I also really wanna be able to start spinning off jumps. So. Where do I start? For rails should I start spinning onto and off of them to prepare for spinning of jumps and getting better at just doing a 50-50 and board slide on a rail? Tips would be GREATLY appreciate - I have a week at the resort so I really wanna to progress my riding BIG TIME.  

&amp;#x200B;

One other thing: I'm bringing my girlfriend and she's never been boarding ever. She can long board well and I think she's gonna do well once she realizes falling will happen a lot and that you can't be afraid. But I'm trying to coach her well so she can come down the mountain with me by the end of the week. So what was helpful to any of you if you learned recently? Or if we have any instructors reading this, what do you think I should do?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Need advice on how to start spinning off jumps and doing rails. Also need advice on how to teach my girlfriend how to board.

A Quick Guide to Heli,"To start there is single day and multi day.

Single day can either be a drop like at Silverton CO or a full day like Harris Heli in Queenstown. When you do a single day, usually there is a run count. The first few runs are for the guide to get a sense of where the group is at. After that, the more the guide trusts you, the more they take you to better runs.

Most of the US / resort based single day heli might be underwhelming. Definitely not the movies. You have a lot of rich people who might not be up for it. This doesn’t mean every single day heli is meh. Stellar heli can put you into some amazing crazy stuff.

Multi heli can be broken down into limited vert, limited HOBBS, unlimited vert, and baller.
CMH runs limited vert. Basically a 7 day trip gets you 100,000 ft vert. Vert is calculated by how many vertical feet you ride. If you’re lapping long 4000ft runs, you can get to your limit quick. After that, there are overage charges.

Silverton Mountain Guides in Alaska runs by HOBBs. HOBBS basically stands for the time the aircraft is in use. If you are flying out 30 minutes to get to a remote range, it will eat into your HOBBs.
Unlimited vert means they will fly all day long until they run out of fuel, run into nasty weather, or until your legs fall off.  Bella Coola in BC is an example of this.
Once you get to baller anything and everything is open. Rent a heli for a month just to learn spines? Sure. 

When you do multi day you can either do small group or large group. Large group is usually 8-10 guests + 2 guides landing in well-marked areas. Pros are it is cheaper, cons, you are moving at the slowest member of the group. If people cant ride powder, there will be a lot of regrouping and instructions.
Small group is usually 1 or 2 guides + up to 4 guests. This allows you to move faster, more runs, and tow ins. Tow ins are when the heli doesn’t land, it just hovers on or near the ridge. Then everyone slowly unloads. It is pretty gnarly.

Private vs groups. When you do private you get the heli all to your self. That means it drops you off at the top and waits for you at the bottom. Once you are loaded, you go. No waiting. Usually unlimited vert or small group helis operate this.

When you do group you are going to be stuck in a zone much longer and lapping the same stuff. When you are in private it is much easier to just head out to a different zone and explorer. In group, you got to slowly move groups from one zone to the next. If a group wants to go home for the day, it holds everyone up.

When in group they will always stop for a good 30 minute lunch break in which they provide food and water. When you do private, you can stop, but do you really want to? Power bars and a thermos is the way to go.

Lodging really depends on the operation. Sometimes they heli you into a remote lodge like CMH Galena and you stay there for the week. The cost covers lodging and three meals.  If they don’t have a lodge, they’ll book hotels for you in town where they suggest you stay, but you’ll have to pay for it yourself.
Some tips:

* Never kick the heli to get snow off your boots. 
* Never open or close any doors. Wait for the guides.
* Always try to grab the seat belt for the person coming or coming out. You got all your gear on, it is tight, help each other out.
* Try to ride with a 10L pack or vest. Taking off a bag and putting it on over and over is a huge pain in the ass and a time waster.
* Listen to the guides. Don’t chase powder where you are not supposed to and end up hiking out.
* The more guides trust you, the more they'll take you to crazier terrain.",snowboarding,1575667702,digitalhomad,True,2019-12-06,0

Trying to go straight down,"Hey guys, long time lurker and now with questions!

I've been snowboarding for the past 4 winters and I am really enjoying this A LOT. Shamefully last winter I got my butt hurt really badly (I'm 30yrs old and fat), and that made me consider looking for advice from the pros! So here I am.

About how I got hurt, I was basically trying to learn riding on goofie and ended up falling a lot on my behinds. I didn't break anything but my insides got bruised, and I had to sit on a cushion donut for a while, actually, until last week. I got hurt in February.

So here are my questions.

1. When I'm going on a straight line, I can see that I start going on a diagonal, really slight angle, and I get really scared and try to start breaking. Why does this happens? How to fix this?

2. How do I start getting a lot better? I know is practice, practice, practice. But I want to aim towards being able to do a mountain trip and really be able to take on everything. Basically, a recipe to success.

3. How do I beat the fear of speed? Or should I do something to start going faster? And how to keep it stable?

Lastly, should I buy butt padding? LOL

Well, I might come to this community for more questions. For now, I will enjoy staring at the snow falling from my window.

Totally fine riding the same mountain for four or five days.  Hoping for great powder riding, mainly in bounds and maybe some light sidecountry.  No terrain park necessary.

Gear suggestions,"Hi guys,

Going to Ischgl (Austria) in mid Jan '20, the average temperature historically is between -10 to -5 Celsius and I am looking for suggestions on layering

I've always been boarding in sunny March/April in the alps and not boarded in mid winter before.

I run decently hot and its being wet/sweaty that gets me down at the end of the day.

I'm usually just in my (entry-level) lightweight baselayer + a polyester tank top and a 15k/15k shell jacket. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for something that is flexible for use in March/April as well

Should I invest in a midweight Icebreaker 250 merino or use lightweight+midlayering?

I recently picked up an OLD Burton A55(pics below) it came with some bindings as well, for its age the entire rig is in amazing condition except for the actual ankle/toe straps. The buckles and the belts are fine, but I guess they used different plastic or rubber for the portion that actually wraps over the ankle/toe because it’s brittle as hell and broken/is breaking.

**PICTURES:** https://imgur.com/a/chzVoe4

Given the age and set up of the rig it looks like I could screw literally any kind of straps onto the base and they’d work just fine. But I’ve been to two shops and both have told me they don’t have anything of the sort. I’ve asked one of the few buddies I know that board about it and he told me it shouldn’t be that hard and that one of his boards has completely mismatched straps
on the bindings that he salvaged. 

My research online has only led me to bits and pieces looking like one Burton ankle strap for $40 which is outrageous. I’m guessing I don’t even need something Burton brand either. I’m new to the scene and also a broke college student so completely new bindings isn’t exactly on the table for me right now.

Need some advice on shipping a snowboard I sold on ebay.. Any info will help!,"Hello Everyone,  


so I recently sold a 151cm Burton Name Dropper on eBay and am having a little bit of trouble trying to figure out the best way to:  


A) Figure out the exact Dimensions of the Board in order to determine those dimensions into the USPS shipping cost calculator on their website to see how much its going to actually cost me to ship this thing  


&amp;  


B) I am in need of any advice on the best way to actually go about securing and shipping this thing without having to worry about it getting damaged along the way as well as not making it so large that the shipping price on the board becomes just ridiculous like I have read and seen it can become

&amp;#x200B;

This is the information i have found online in regards to the actual dimensions of the snowboard but am still having some trouble figuring out which one of these are the dimensions I actually need..  


&amp;#x200B;

[The board I have is the 151 so I figured the actual length of the board would obviously be 151cm or just under 60 inches which I have also heard is key that when shipping it that it needs to be under 60inches to help with the pricing](https://preview.redd.it/5c0qw9gzzj341.png?width=1166&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42b6e26f3eb73699bbc8bc708ed62786cdd64559)

  
But at the same time I cant figure out which on of these is the proper size I would use for the actual width of the board and then I'm assuming I would just put it as around 2inches or so high for the hight part of the box dimensions?  


And then yeah what is the best way to go about shipping the thing and protecting it?  


I have read online on a forum somewhere that people commented and said the best way to do this would be to get some bubble wrap or protective type foam and then wrap it in a burrito type fashion along with your standard Medium sized shipping Box from home depot but ripping the box along the seams and then wrapping it around the board in a burrito fashion as well..  


They said that this along with printing the shipping label off at home and not bringing it in to the store is a lot better of a way to do this considering its an oversized package and if its printed off at home they are a lot more forgiving than they are if you actually bring it into the store for them to weigh out and measure themselves  


But does anyone have any advice or gone through this process themselves and have any knowledge or advice than can give me so it doesn't shoot through the roof on trying to ship this thing?  


I am planning on shipping it from Los Angeles to San Francisco so not to far but still I have seen some of the prices and they can be pretty astronomical since its such an oversized package.. so any advice will be greatly appreciative!

Step ons,"Just wanted to write my thoughts on the step on product as I was curious before buying and now that I've ridden them maybe my review will help some other redditor decide. 

They are pretty fantastic honestly. Super snappy and responsive to your movement, feels great to ride. Super nice to not have any straps to tighten mid run or between runs, same goes for boot laces as they're dual boa lacing. 

Downsides so far are minimal, only thing I can think of is its a bit tricky to step OUT of them on an incline, but I'm sure I'll get better at that and it's not even really an issue.

Foot pain and cramping in snowboard boots,"I have been snowboarding basically my whole life. I never used to have any issues with my feet but in the past few years I have started to get extremely painful cramping in my feet. I think it starts under my arches and on the outsides of my feet and then it eventually spreads to the balls of my feet and up into my legs until my whole legs cramp and burn. Often I can barely make it through a whole run without having to stop and rest my feet and try to relax all the cramping. 

I have a high arch and instep. I get pain and pressure on the tops of my feet even in sneakers or street boots and this will cause my feet to fall asleep, but no cramping. I have tried a bunch of different boots on and have worn them around the house and usually within 20 minutes or so, the cramping will start.

I have tried a bunch of different things to troubleshoot this problem:
-- met with multiple reputable boot fitters
-- changing angles of my bindings
-- changing width of my stance
-- tightening and loosening binding straps
-- tightening and loosening laces
-- custom footbeds
-- other aftermarket footbeds like Soles, Superfeet, etc.
-- thicker socks, thinner socks
-- trying to focus on relaxing my feet in my boots while riding

What’s a good upgrade to a freestyle all mountain/trench digging setup?,"Shredlords, need some advice on how to upgrade my current setup (first setup).

My stats: 31 yrs old, 6’1, 165 lbs, US size 10.5 feet, ride at +15,-15

Experience/riding style: intermediate boarder (~4 years boarding). No park, focused on freestyle all mountain, basically want to Ryan knapton around shallow pitched wide runs most of the time (we should make a verb around that guys riding). But yeah, really into laid out carves, butter rolls, the odd 180/360 off a roller etc.


My setup, what I like and what I wanna improve on:

Snowboard: [Rome Agent 2017](https://www.evo.com/outlet/snowboards/rome-agent-snowboard?image=104110/456194/rome-agent-snowboard-2017-156.jpg&amp;pt_source=googleads&amp;pt_medium=cpc&amp;pt_campaign=GSC_Snowboarding&amp;pt_adgroup=PLA_Snowboarding&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAv9riBRANEiwA9Dqv1bz6iBo_sEtZvqukLThC0osmEi-FX7T81arRmqVPADNW0lTLewQB2RoCtboQAvD_BwE)  - it’s a 161MW with a 26.5cm waist - I.e no matter what my carving angle I usually don’t feel any toe or heel drag. Love the camber spring into and out of turns, stability at speed, short quick carves feel amazing with the side cut. Working on goofy riding/carving so directional twin shape helps. But...it is unforgiving - and a LOT of snowboard to throw around. Thinking of getting a [korua Otto](https://www.koruashapes.com/classic/model/otto) but unsure - worth it y’all think? No chance to demo it - any other boards that cater to carving (I.e. side cut on point and wide enough) but also allow for some freestyle all mountain fun? 

Bindings: [union forces](https://www.evo.com/outlet/snowboard-bindings/union-force-2017) - is it worth it to upgrade bindings? Was thinking of getting stiffer ones for more response, and perhaps ones that have faster binding angle adjustment and don’t require open heart surgery to change angles. Any suggestions for bindings that won’t break the bank?

Boots: [burton photon 2017](https://www.evo.com/outlet/snowboard-boots/burton-photon-boa-2017)-  bought these slightly used so they are not as stiff and bend a bit around the ankle. Further, my feet esp around the toes hurt and get numb, I have to pop the top boa and loosen bindings every time I get up the lift, take a break every 4-5 runs and loosen up the whole setup, etc. 
worth it to upgrade? Was thinking of either getting a heat mold+insole done to these, or just upgrading to something like Ride Insano (super stiff low length profile boot, ideal for carving) 

Thoughts guys? Any deals y’all know that get at this stuff would be great! And I am hoping this thread will help other freestyle all mountaineers!",snowboarding,1575076143,sheedapistawl,True,2019-11-29,0

1000+ mile trip for some Colorado beauty!,"Hey everyone! Hoping to take a journey from Tennessee to Colorado next weekend to hit some slopes and was hoping to get some advice. I'm planning to stay for a week or so and board for 3-4 of those days, and torn between a couple options at the moment. The Keystone Crested Butte 4 pack seems like a great bargain at $250, but not sure I'd make it to CB, as it seems hardly any trails are open atm. Being the 4 pack is so cheap, maybe there would be a possibility of hitting winterpark for one of those 4 days? Alternatively, I could buy a 3 day epic pass for $320 and spread the days out between a larger variety of resorts. Clearly, the first option seems like the way to go for days per dollar, but leaning more towards the 3 day pass as I'm thinking I may get bored by the 3rd or 4th day at keystone with their seemingly limited trail openings. I'd say I'm a bit more skilled than a beginner, but will still be relearning myself the first day. I guess my question would be 1 day each at keystone, breck, and vail, or 3 to 4 days at keystone with the possibility of an extra day at winter park? Another question I have is about beaver sports shop. I plan to rent from the for 4 or 5 days, but not sure to go with the mid grade performance boards or go with a demo rental? Being newer I am afraid the demo boards will be a bit too advanced for myself, but at the same time it may have a better experience having it for 4 days straight.

Board Advice 2020 - Intermediate to Advanced All Mountain,"Hi all, I'm trying to narrow down a new board for 2020 after a great 2019 season here in New Zealand.

There's so many options out there and I don't have the ability to demo anything, so thought I would seek some advice. 

I primarily ride small club skifields here in the South Island of New Zealand. Think, little or no grooming, mix of powder/chalk/corn/firm/ice (sometimes within a day), rope tows, t- bars and bootpacking, generally a wide variety of conditions and terrain. I'm not bothered about park of groomer performance as I hardly ever ride these. Lots of steeps, natural features, chutes, moguls etc. 

About me:  
Just got back into boarding after an 8-year hiatus, I'm 25 now and haven't been on the snow since 16 before this year. Progressed rapidly back to intermediate-advanced level and by the end of the season was charging black runs and could generally ride the whole mountain bar the super sketchy double blacks. My current beginner set up was not cutting the mustard for this at all. Character building I guess.   
I am about 5'9"" and 130lbs, definitely on the smaller side for a guy. 

I would say that I ride freeride/all mountain, with a focus on speed, big turns and carving. I do jumps off natural features or kickers but nothing big (still learning). Would like to be able to butter as well but not fussed on jibs.

I want the ability to ride switch as I am working on this, and I can only justify having one daily driver with my old board as a beater for early season rocky days and for my GF when she comes up with me. 

For boots I have a relatively new set of 2019 Burton Ruler BOA's and bindings are some generic snowpro plastic things that came on my 2nd hand board. Boots are great, get numb feet after a while when they're tight. Bindings are ok and not sure how bad they are really as I haven't tried anything else. They seem alright, fully adjustable and pretty stiff. 4 bolt mounting so channel lock boards are out I guess.

So far I have narrowed these down as options for a new board but might be way off, I have no idea about camber profiles having only ridden a standard camber board, and there are just so many options I don't even really know where to start.

Natural at riding switch?,"Hello all! I’ve lived in Washington my whole life and have only been snowboarding twice, once on a school trip as a junior in high school. I got a lesson and rentals and picked it up quick and had a great day. Flash forward about 4 years later I’m 20 and learning again. I didn’t take lessons this time but got my own gear and headed out with my boyfriend who’s more experienced than me. We went out on the first weekend a resort close to us opened. In hindsight was probably a bad idea for me, as re-learning involves a lot of falling. I don’t know if it was the lack of snow, the over abundance of ice or just the pressure to be good. But I felt like it was much harder this time around. I clearly remember in high school leaving the lesson and then easily riding around on green slopes the rest of the day, but it was mid season with a lot of snow on the ground. Does more snow make it easier? Last time I went I rode goofy, this time I also started goofy and realized throughout the day that I could switch back and forth between goofy and regular pretty easily and comfortably. Is that normal? Should I pick one to get better at or just roll with it? And lastly, anyone have any tips at all for a somewhat beginner?

Best Mountain in Colorado?,"Hey guys, last night I received a very early Christmas present from the girlfriend and she got us tickets to fly to Denver! Super stoked and thankful for her as she is also planning to take me to any mountain I want there as my birthday lines up with when were arriving too.

My question is what do you guys think the best mountain is for snowboarding? I want to see Vail, but anything will beat my slopes in PA. 

Criteria would probably just have to be a place that is consistently good conditions, not long lift lines (Although if the trails are long, I can probably deal considering long trails that we are used to is maybe 45 seconds to get down), has a fun terrain park with wider lanes.

I am by no means an expert but I can definitely hold my own on the mountain and I do like hitting some intermediate terrain features. Slightly more excited to shred pow and bowls though considering I never see that close to where I am at.

My girlfriend is a beginner and this is her first season. So far she can get down the mountain pretty well and stop on her toe edge, we have plenty of time to get her better too as we will be going to our home resort every weekend here soon.

Our friend who lives there is decent at skiing and is probably only slightly lower than I am in skill level, but knows the mountains and will be our guide.

We're staying in Denver with one of our friends that lives out there so lodging is not a problem, as well as the drive too considering we are only getting one day of boarding in (sadly). This is also going to be my 21st birthday too so were going to be hanging out in Boulder and seeing the city.

I appreciate it guys, any advice helps, including good food and drink places in Boulder!",snowboarding,1575472834,Hexxiz,True,2019-12-04,0

speaker during boarding,"Hey fellow boarders! When I am boarding I love to listen to music, but I don't want to be wearing earphones because I want to be able to hear my surroundings.

Second, every time I'm stopping where others are also stopping I want to pause the music/reduce the volume so I'm not bothering anyone, but that requires me to take of a glove, reach in my pocket and interact with my phone. 

So what I'm looking for, is a way to bring the speaker closer to my face without it being a risk that I fall on it (breast pocket sounds like I might break my ribs on it) and some way to control the music comfortably and reliably without having to take my gloves of.

Fixing my carving,"Heyo, I've been snowboarding for about 15 years, since I was 7, about 50 days on snow a year. This year, I got on snow and every heelside turn my board felt chattery, like I was slipping out, and the couple times I really pushed my edge, I would just go right down, as if my binding was hitting the ground. I found I was trying to kind of bend my back knee toward my front knee to turn on my heelside. I was dumbfounded so I looked up some videos and they said you need to square your hips. I definitely learned this way, and somewhere along I started shifting my weight more toward the front of the board, and turning my hips out too, instead of staying square in my heelside turn. I was thinking of what may have contributed to me ""unlearning"" how to carve properly, and I think maybe riding a super dull park board for years made me compensate due to not being able to turn on ice (east coast, lots of ice). I went out again today and started squaring my hips more and voila, I remembered how to snowboard. Have any long-time snowboarders ever come across this issue?

So what’s the advice for someone like me looking to mix it up with something more maneuverable after having no experience with it?  Should I stay in my (right) lane and continue my stiff setup?

Have You Broken Your Action Cam While Snowboarding?,"I just purchased a GoPro 8 along with the free trial of GoPro PLUS which covers accidental damage. The free trial of GoPro PLUS is also great because it gave me 50% off some of the accessories.

I also bought the tempered glass casings and the housing (because I dive).

Please stand with us! Boycott Backcountry.com this holiday season.,"**History and Background**

* Backcountry.com was sold to a private equity firm, and their longtime CEO resigned.
* Recently they attempted to trademark the term ""backcountry"".
* They began various legal efforts against organizations that use the term ""backcountry"" in their name, including lawsuits.
* Some local companies had to change their names, incurring legal fees, etc.
* Some companies fought them.

**The Boycott So Far**

* There is a boycott underway of Backcountry.com in defense of the companies they are bullying, and against the trademark claim.
* The boycott has *partially* worked.
* They fired the law firm they were using.
* They've made *some* amends with some local businesses they legally attacked.

**Why Keep Boycotting?**

* They still haven't let go of their ridiculous trademark claims.  They could still sue or bully businesses in the future, pretty much any business or organization that tries to use ""backcountry"" in their name.
* The CEO of a company that commits this type of legal bullying needs to resign.  We can't trust Backcountry.com until it is under new leadership.
* **This is the most important time of year for a retailer like Backcountry.com.**  We can make our voices heard the clearest and loudest by boycottting **now**.

Make a stand with us.  There are plenty of other retailers that have very competitive pricing and gear that will happily have your business.  These can be found both online and locally.",snowboarding,1574886659,joejance,True,2019-11-27,0

Deciding between Jones Flagship and Jones Frontier,"Hello everyone, I hope this is the appropriate place to ask this question.

This will be my 3rd season of serious snowboarding, rode about 25 days the first year, 35 last year and am expecting to ride about 45 this season. I'd rate my skills in the intermediate - advanced range. (I can comfortably ride most blacks and some double blacks at the major hills here in BC) I don't do park, jumps, spins or any of that sort of thing. I basically just look for fun tree runs, powder and technical terrain within the resort areas. My goals by the end of this season is to be able to do any double black diamond runs, and hopefully do some free ride zones such as the Delirium Dive at Sunshine. Currently riding an entry level board with a flat bottom and rocker on the ends (Ride Control 160).

I feel like my current board is limiting my progression and I want something that will enable me to be confident on the more difficult terrain I will be doing by the end of this season. I have the hardest time on very steep icy terrain and am hoping a board with better edge hold and carving ability will compensate for that.

I'm trying to decide if the Flagship is the appropriate choice, or if maybe my skills aren't high enough to make proper use of it and I should get something a bit more forgiving like the Frontier. Money isn't an issue.

\-Do I need a high level board like the flagship to handle difficult double blacks in poor conditions, or will the Frontier be sufficient?

\-What sort of skill level should I be at in order to make use of an advanced/expert board like the flagship? I've never used a camber board before and am intimidated by the potential change. Will using a board above my level potentially slow my progression?

\-Will a stiff board like the flagship be able to handle tight tree runs and more playful stuff at slower speeds? I realize it's not designed specifically for those purposes, but will it be better or worse than my current board?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",snowboarding,1574223654,SpamElemental,True,2019-11-19,0

All mountain/freestyle charger for Southern Ontario: Never Summer Ripsaw or Signal Disruptor,"In my 3rd full season, I have a 149cm headspace and I'm looking for a second board that's still freestyle but better for  all mountain charging and big jumps.  I ride in Southern Ontario with short runs and lots of ice/hard groomers so need something with good edge hold on ice and still spend most of the time doing short park runs. 

I've spent a lot of time debating and mostly looking at the Signal Disruptor and Never Summer Ripsaw now.  My only concern is that both of them seem to be labelled as unforgiving and I'm still progressing and don't have a ton of confidence.   I can ride switch semi-comfortably (though not at top speed) and land medium jumps without spins.  I'm wondering if they might be too catchy for me to keep progressing with confidence.

There's very little info on the disruptor out there, but it sounds roughly like what I'm looking for and the price is right, especially with the subscription. 

Any thoughts, or a third board I really should be considering instead that has those elements but more forgiving?

Yes Standard vs. Yes Ghost,"So I've been boarding for about 9 years now. Back in middle school, I bought the 2010 Ride DH limited edition with flow bindings. I am now 6'0'' 175-190lbs with size 12 boots. In Jackson hole, my bindings broke and I finally got to demo a new board. It was a 2019 burton free thinker and I loved it. Can't tell if it was the board or my lack of being on a new board in years. Anyway, this is how a day at a resort looks like for me... at the top of the lift, I try and find any fresh powder runs that I can hike up to. I constantly look for the best tree runs that have some great natural kickers within them. Once I get back on to the groomers I immediately try and get back into tree runs again aiming for ones with natural terrain park features. Its always a huge bonus if I make my way through tree runs and end up finding an actual terrain park and here I will hit all the jumps and rails it has to offer (crazy jibbing is my current weakness though). I then fuck around with some butters and ollies until I get back to the lift. 

I have done a lot of searching through all-mountain/freestyle boards and its come down to the Yes standard and Yes ghost. (if you have better opinions please comment) But if you agree with these two for my style and have experience riding them please help me pick between the two and help me decide if I can purchase an older model to save money or If I should just send it with the new models because its worth the money.

Protective gear recommendations from an old guy,"relatively unobtrusive protective gear that can really make snowboarding, at any level, slightly less painful and injurious, in my personal opinion is widely under used. 

This applies to snowboarders of every level with the exception of people who are,bizarrely imho,satisfied just cruising easy groomers at moderate speed who have a bit of experience. If you are new, wear protection. If you like to challenge yourself wear protection. 

I highly recommend, in addition to the usual helmet, tailbone protection and wrist protection. There are a lot of brands that offer this. 

Why should you wear this stuff? 

If you snowboard for any length of time, you will fall hard on your wrist or your ass. Wrist are incredibly sensitive and fragile. Tailbones are pretty tough but a good solid hit that really hurts is inevitable. The problem with both of these areas is that if you really bang them up they will either take a really really really long time to heal, or never quite heal 100%, or be significantly damaged permanently. 

Once you have hurt your tailbone or wrist it will not be as good as new. Even if it heals up, it just gets easier and easier to re-injure with every successive injury. it's a lot lot easier and better to avoid f'ing it up in the first place.

I personally recommend a 2 sided wrist guard built into the glove. personal favorite: dakine wristguard glove. 

avoid burton because falls apart instantly.  Demon wrist guard gloves stink. bad protection and just basically the in every way worse version than the dakine.  


serius: never tested anyone use these? 

Level: Tried them on. I'm not convinced the fancy and complicated protection will do what i want. Anyone comment? 




Tailbone protection: 

imho you don't need thigh protection or hip protection. Azzpadz d30 is the best ive found. Impact shorts are worse protection with more hassles. you'd be shocked hat the d30 azzpadz will let you bounce back up from. I've massively overshot jumps and completely cratered and just bounced back up no problems. This goes over your base layer and under your snowpants. If you have classic fit snowpants, it's difficult to tell you are wearing it visually, but it's a lifesaver. Because you don't wear it next to your body you can avoid having to wash it all the time like the shorts. 

 

Common misconceptions: 

""Wrist guards will break your arm"". This is the most annoying myth ever because it's incredibly stupid for 2 reasons. The first reason is that if you fall on your hand hard enough to break your arm, you are far far better off breaking your arm than breaking your wrist. Your arm is sturdy and very very simple. When it heals it will be fine. your wrist is fragile and complicated. it will almost certainly be worse forever. Feel free to ask anyone in orthopedic medicine which one, on average takes longer to heal and has more risk of long term issues. 

This myth is also silly because modern wrist guards are flexible and not stronger than your arm. They are not strong enough to break you arm, and this is immediately apparent just by picking one up and flexing it, so the people saying ""it will break your arm"" have literally never even had a wrist guard from the last 15 years in their hands. 

It is true that a 1990's skateboard wrist guard was stiff enough to move a wrist impact up into a forearm injury, but as already said, this is still much preferable. 

Am i missing any products? Anyone else want to chime in on protection items?

bonus tip: use black shoe goo to repair your gear. If you want to to look neater, tape off the area to be repaired. This works great on pants and jackets. Works awesome on gloves too but good luck not having it come out kinda ugly. As a park rat this doubles the length of time i can get out of gloves. Fixing early is key. don't wait for the rip/tear/hole to get huge.",snowboarding,1574449522,TimeTomorrow,True,2019-11-22,0

Landed my first frontside boardslide today! Sorry no footy :(,"We got about 3 inches of snow earlier this week, so I have been on my homemade 10' PVC flat rail any chance I get. I just learned how to do back boardslides in October, and I've been trying front boards without any success until today! 

As far as my learning process, like I said I learned backside boardslides first (and 50-50's before that, of course) and then started trying to do FS boards with no success. I was doing the counter rotation but it never felt really good and I couldn't get the board more than 30 degrees rotated, and I fell quite a few times. Today, I went back to the process of how I learned backsides, which was to start 50-50 and then shifty to a boardslide at the end of the rail. I still kept going up on an edge and losing my balance when I eventually tried going right into the FS board, then I realized that I wasn't keeping my weight over my board. After a couple more tries and figuring out my balance, I realized that I was opening my shoulders to the rail on my approach too, so I started to keep my front shoulder forward almost like I was trying NOT to look at the ramp, and that helped get my rotation dialed in. Last thing I realized was that I had been trying to do everything basically with my upper body, so I just focused on really counter-rotating with my feet and getting a little more pop off the ramp, and then it locked in! Of course, it's not perfect yet, but I got at least three good ones in a row before I took a break.

My advice to anyone learning front boards:

1) Keep your hands toward the tail of your board on the approach but close to your body.
2) Rotate your front shoulder slightly forward and spot the rail out of the corner of your vision.
3) Pop off the ramp and keep your balance centered over your board while you counter rotate.
4) Try to diagnose any problems related to speed, balance, and shifting your weight in your feet.",snowboarding,1574469306,lukamu,True,2019-11-22,0
Question about flying with multiple snowboards,"Hey all.  So I'm doing a bit of traveling this coming season and I have been researching baggage policies regarding snowboard/ski equipment across all major airlines.  It seems that the ones I have checked so far (United, American Airlines, Alaska Airlines, and Delta) all seem to have a very similar policy.  This following quote is directly from United Airlines website:

"" United accepts one item of ski or snowboard equipment per customer as checked baggage. Equipment must be securely encased in a suitable container. An item of ski equipment consists of: 

\- Up to two snowboards in one bag and one snow boot bag 

 Ski equipment in addition to the baggage allowance will be assessed at the current excess baggage charge for a single piece, whether or not it is presented as a single piece. ""

It also mentions in the policy that the snowboard bag cannot weigh over 50 lbs or you will be charged $100 for overweight baggage.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's my question, I would like to bring my entire quiver of 5 boards.  The bag with the boards weighs in at 48 lbs so it will be within weight allowances.  If I am reading these policies correctly, the airlines have the right to deny me flying with more than 2 boards??  And even if they allow more boards on the plane, they may make me take three to four of the boards out of the bag and check them separately?? which seems insane (and very expensive).  

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone experienced issues with this?  Do they actually open the snowboard bags and hassle you if you have more than one or two boards?

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I have read that some people just ship the boards through postal service ahead of time to avoid the airline fees. Any experience doing this?  Sorry for the wall of text and thanks for reading.  Any guidance would be appreciated =\]",snowboarding,1574474145,njdiver,True,2019-11-22,0

My intention is to use this board most days as a more fun alternative to the flagship and pull that one out when its dumping. I'd say I am leaning towards the Capita as I have a Jones already but I feel like the mountain twin is the better board for what I am looking for?

"Colorado resort suggestions for powder, bowls, and jumps?","Hello! My 2 friends and I are planning a 5-day trip to Denver, Colorado about 1-2 months from now to explore the area and snowboard, but we don't know much about that area/resorts. We live in east coast, NC, and we have a few small resorts here; lots of fake blown snow, sometimes a few inches of real snow, and often icy conditions. The best conditions we get are at Snowshoe in WV, maybe 1 trip there per year.

They're both intermediate/blues, but can slowly make it down blacks and are practicing more before the trip. I'm more advanced/expert and confident with double blacks. We will snowboard together most of the time, but I can't go to Colorado and not do some expert runs, so I will likely split from them for at least a half day.

**What Colorado mountain suggestions would you have for us based on below?**

* Most of all, we all want powder. 5'+ of powder would be a dream, but 1' would be great.
** (Do the CO resorts get powder like this, or do you have to get a lucky powder day or go off-piste?)
* I'd like to try some bowls, like for fast and wide carving; we don't really have that here.
* I'd love to try some 10-20' jumps (we only have 10' max here), and some ~5' jumps for my friends.
* None of us really do park (rails/etc). I'm not good enough for any interest in a half-pipe.
* Preferably not large crowds / long lift lines

Anyone have an experience to share at Pro-Ride or Core snowboard camp (freestyle) from the last couple years?

This would be my first camp and second trip to whistler. I plan to go for a week in early February.

Most reviews seem to be people who took the free-riding camp or CASI training. I'd love to hear someone's experience with the freestyle portion of camp. I.e. did your group get to venture into the back country to build jumps? If there was a dump over night, could you get a few pow lines in before beginning training? How much do you feel you truly improved for 15 hours of training? What was your skill level before vs after? Did you notice the other riders around you take a step up in improvement as well? Did you feel the coaches were good at ""teaching"" you new tricks? What was a typical day like (jumps vs. rails/boxes)? 

If anyone has taken the free-ride program, I'd love to hear your experience as well. I obviously want to grow my bag of tricks more than anything and it seems there's room to do so no matter which route I choose. I'm merely leaning towards the freestyle program as the park is where I tend to find myself the last few years. Also, I'm 30 now and my days of huck and pray may be limited.

Please help me find my dream board?,"Quick backstory. Went from being a complete novice to a gear snob in training, because I worked at a rental, repair, and tune shop at a local mountain here in VT. 

I was already super into the design and build of snowboard tech before it became my full time job for two years. When I was working there I had the knowledge and resources to study and even demo all the different types of snowboard tech.

Why is this important? 

Well if you know everything about a snowboard and it’s design you will get a better idea of how it rides. Take all the factors into account and from this invest the money into the perfect ride.

(I hope everyone in this community dose this. Snowboards are not cheap you should know exactly what you are buying) 

CONCLUSION!!! 

So I have bought a few boards, my quiver is almost complete and specialized to me. 

BUT I’m missing the final piece. If anyone know where I can find a....

 SIMS Dealers Choice with the 2017/18 graphic!!!! 

A few years ago sims started pressing boards again in the never summer factory. THIS was the perfect board for me and Tom Sims was my Hero. Also yes the graphic dose matter. They made ONE more iteration in 2018/19 season but the graphic was trash. Now they are done pressing boards in the name of Tom Sims (last I heard.) After two years of research I know in my heart of hearts that this board will be the perfect final piece to my quiver.

But I was broke when it came out. Now that I have a steady job I can’t find it any were.

Got a Burton Ross Powers 58 for my first board. Is it at all beginner friendly?,"At the end of last season I started boarding. Went 3 times and the last was at a pretty nice mountain (Elk Mountain). The weather was supposed to suck so the place was empty. Cue 10 inches of fresh snow and I'm addicted to boarding. Riding ungroomed black diamonds on my third day, only alive because the powder gave me enough control to learn, it was heaven. So a couple weeks after, I picked up the Ross Powers 58 for only $20. 

Last night, the first ride, was the second day the slopes were open. Considering the only slope that was open and any distance was a half ice, mobile filled black diamond, I had no opportunity to feel out my board. It was very much survival. That said, this board felt a lot stiffer, heavier, and less forgiving than the one I had ridden before. I feel i could ride it well but am not sure it'll be a fun learning curve.

Riding in flat light,"Hey all, I've been riding for a few years and skiing for a few years before that, so I'm pretty familiar with the snow, various levels of visibility, etc.

Something that's always gotten to me though is that in the afternoon the light gets really flat and it gets hard to see the definition in the snow. Little bumps and divots, or icy spots and clumps of snow become invisible and the entire run just looks like one flat slab (even though of course it's not). It makes me feel like at any second I could hit an invisible bump and wipe out. So this means I almost never ride after 1:30pm-ish (some days the light last a bit longer, some days not).

The people I ride with don't seem to notice or care though, so I'm wondering if maybe it's not as big a deal as I'm imagining? Should I be able to incorporate bumps and divots as I feel them in my legs instead of trying to find them visually?

I’ve been snowboarding for about 6-7 years now and finally am treating myself to buying a board now that I’m not a broke college kid. I have a few questions about choosing a board that are a little difficult to answer following different sizing/experience guidelines.

1. I’m a  5’ 11” male and weigh ~168 lbs.
2. I’ve tried to go 1-2 times a season for the last 7 years. I have decent speed on the descent and will hit a few jumps/hops on the way down, but never really mess in the terrain.
3. Where I have to board there’s never any guarantee on weather conditions- sometimes it’s great powder, sometimes it’s the slushy, and sometimes it’s slushy during the day, but frozen solid at night. Anyways, I’ll need something that can handle all conditions.
4. I’ve always rented from the same place and they’ve given me a Lib T 155, but I can’t remember if it was a wide board or not.
5. I wear a size 11 boot so I’m assuming I’ll need a wide? Does a wider board effect performance?
6. Happy to take brand recommendations. I really like the looks of Burtons, some Arbors and DC’s. Open to considerations though.

Looking for alpha testers for a new mobile app for skiing/snowboarding!,"Hey guys,

I'm indy developer and I'm really close to launch new mobile app for skiing/snowboarding.

But before launching I'd like to test core of the app - tracking system. It should detect riding/lift/rest time very accurate. That's why I need real tracks. 

Unfortunately, I can't test it right now. But I'm sure some of you can.

That's why I ask community to help.

If you wish to help - just download test tracker. Launch it when you session begins and press start button. Then press stop button at the end of a day. Do not turn it off in a lift or in a restaurant.

[https://snowduck.app.link/alpha](https://snowduck.app.link/alpha) 

I really appreciate your help! All alpha testers will receive pro accounts for ever!

Thank you in advance!

PS.

If you have iPhone you should install testFlight app (this is Apple application for alpha/beta testing). Just follow the instruction.

- Capita Mercury

NO SNOWBOARD BAG.

Solo Trip Tahoe,"Hi everyone,

As I have got older I have fewer friends to hit up the mountains with as life and such gets in the way. I have just decided to fuck it and go solo this year for some riding, I am looking at the Tahoe area as I have never hit up California for riding.

I have been riding for 15 years now, pretty advanced, have hit up Japan, Alaska, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, BC, and Vermont. I don't really do park anymore and mostly stick to slack country, deep powder runs and chutes. I am into photography as well so downtime between days I am open to shoot photos of the landscapes and whatnot. 

Can anyone recommend me which mountain would be best for a solo powderhound, I plan to hit up the hills during the week to avoid lines so the less packed a mountain is the better for me as well, I will have a rental car so getting around won't be an issue and I am from Canada and know how to drive in snow so I was thinking of flying into Reno and getting an AirBnb or something towards the mountains and using that as a base camp to hit up some mountains.

Any tips and recommendations would be amazing, thank you.",snowboarding,1573485881,416snowboarder,True,2019-11-11,0

Snowboard Wax Problem,"Hey guys, I'm having a problem with waxing my Bataleon Jam. The board has never been used and this is my first time waxing it. I've waxed other boards before without a problem, so I'm not sure what is going wrong. When scraping, the wax in certain areas seems to crack all the way off. From what I can tell, in the area the wax cracks off, there is no wax. At least none that I can scrape off with a fingernail. 

I was just wondering if you guys had experience with this or what to do next. My only guess is that I didn't have the iron hot enough when applying the wax, causing it not to soak in. I know the wax is not to blame, I used it on other boards the same night I applied the wax to this board with no problems.

We typically like to stay close to the mountain for skiing and being able to stop in for lunch, however we also like to hit the bars and often stay out late. That brings me to my questions.

If we stay by the base (ski in/out) do we have an easy way to access the town

1. How late does the gondola to the village run?
2. Is uber active in the area that we can use that? If yes, how far of a drive is that roughly?

Alternatively, would you recommend staying in town instead and taking the gondola over? (How long of a gondola ride is it between town and base?)

Thanks!",snowboarding,1573672190,Mustin_Dillis,True,2019-11-13,0
Sugarbush Sold to Alterra,"Per an email that just came through- 



Dear Sugarbush Community,
 
For me, today is a bit like walking my daughter down the aisle at her wedding. I have tears in my eyes and a lump in my throat knowing that I am about to give away someone I have raised and loved. Looking down the aisle, however, I am delighted to see someone waiting who will also love, respect, and care for her as I have done. While things will not be the same, I am excited about this next stage of our lives. And, I am comforted knowing that we are not saying goodbye!

Today Summit Ventures NE LLC is announcing that it has agreed to sell the majority of its Sugarbush assets to Alterra Mountain Company. They currently own 14 very special destinations in North America and partner with an additional 27 around the world on their Ikon Pass. The transaction is expected to close in early January 2020 subject to regulatory approvals.

I have been asked to remain as president for as long as I wish in order to facilitate a smooth transition, to maintain our commitment to our guests and to the entire Sugarbush community, and to prepare the next generation of leaders to succeed me when I decide to move on to a third career. More importantly, Alterra Mountain Company wants our entire Sugarbush team to remain in place. They are buying a place they believe is working well and do not have plans to change our mission, our values, our brand, our culture, or our team. They recognize our commitment to the Mad River Valley community and want that to continue as well.

Eighteen years ago, my family and three others purchased Sugarbush from the American Skiing Company with the intention of restoring Sugarbush to what it was when founded by the Gadd, Murphy, and Estin families in 1958. Thanks to support from our loyal guests, the community here in the Mad River Valley and the terrific team here at Sugarbush, we have turned an unprofitable and deteriorating resort into one that is profitable and respected throughout the industry. We are proud to have recently celebrated our 60th anniversary and to have continued to cultivate a spirit of lifelong adventure and camaraderie among our guests, staff, and community.

Over the years of our ownership, we have turned down several offers to sell Sugarbush and have prided ourselves on being independently owned and operated. However, recent events in the ski industry and the challenge of rising costs posed both by climate change and by doing business in Vermont have convinced me that a new owner is needed to ensure a sustainable future for Sugarbush. Until now I had not laid out a succession plan and identified who would be the best future custodian of Sugarbush. Most importantly, I needed to find someone who would care for Sugarbush as we have and our entire Sugarbush community would expect. I have found such an owner in Alterra Mountain Company.

The multi-resort season pass has changed the landscape. It will be increasingly difficult for ski areas like Sugarbush to compete alone against Vail Resorts, Alterra Mountain Company, and others like POWDR and Boyne Resorts. The recent acquisition of Peak Resorts by Vail was the tipping point in my decision.

Because of the ongoing challenges associated with climate change and stronger competition, the amount of capital required to remain sustainable will be far greater in the years ahead. In my opinion, Sugarbush will be better able to make these necessary investments as a member of the Alterra Mountain Company family. While there are many wonderful features about Vermont, the cost of doing business here is greater than in many other states. Being able to find efficiencies by being part of a larger organization in things such as purchasing power or our employees being part of a larger health insurance pool or having more affordable workers’ compensation options were other considerations in my decision.

Many of us have gotten to know the leadership team at Alterra Mountain Company over the past few years, and we had a very good experience partnering with their Ikon Pass last winter. Their philosophy is one of building a family of iconic destinations, each with their own unique brands, cultures, and identities that operate within unique communities. It is important to note that one of their major shareholders, Henry Crown &amp; Company of Chicago, has owned Aspen- Snowmass for decades, and brings an important family perspective to Alterra Mountain Company. They are also focused on the long-term. Having spoken with the Crown family I am confident that their involvement will be valuable in helping to maintain the independent-minded culture of each destinations within the Alterra Mountain Company family. And, importantly all whom we have met at Alterra Mountain Company team are passionate skiers or riders like us here at Sugarbush.

For winter 19/20, all current Sugarbush Resort products and local passes will be honored as usual as our Golf and Health &amp; Recreation Center passes. Ikon Pass access will not change with 7-day access on the Ikon Pass and 5-Day access on the Ikon Base Pass. We also remain part of the Mountain Collective. Any pass product changes will be considered after we close in early January 2020 and before spring pass sales begin.

I never thought I would become an employee again, but I am excited to do so because I believe in Alterra Mountain Company and its mission, I believe in our Sugarbush team, I love our community, and I am bullish about our future together. And, of course, my family’s commitment to the Mad River Valley will remain as strong as ever. I can assure you that I have no plans to retire to a gated golf community in Florida and still plan to ski at least 100 days this season and in many more years to come.

On Wednesday, November 20th we will have an open forum for the Sugarbush community where I and our executive team will be joined by members of the leadership team from Alterra Mountain Company to speak about our transaction, share more about Alterra Mountain Company and our future plans and answer any and all questions. This will begin at 5pm in the Gate House Lodge and all are welcome. We also plan to record the forum so that those unable to attend may view and hear our discussion later. As always, I am available by email (wsmith@sugarbush.com), phone, or in person to answer any questions you might have.

I am looking forward to riding the first chair up the mountain on Saturday, November 23 (or possibly November 22 for a passholder appreciation day), successfully forerunning Pond Skimming in the spring, skiing at least 100 days this winter, and having a final run with many of you on Sunday, May 3. In the meantime, it is feeling like winter, we are staffing-up, our snowmakers have been hard at work this past week, and Mother Nature has already delivered some nice snow.

I remain enthusiastic about the future of Sugarbush and look forward to seeing you on the slopes very soon.

Burn mark on board? Newbie help.,"Hi, I just got my first snowboard and it's used. Generally the bottom of the board is pretty decent and smooth but there was one light scratch (maybe a 1/2mm deep, so not very). I figured I'd try and heat up a spatula with a lighter and smooth it out... Bad idea. The carbon (I guess) seems to gotten onto the bottom of the board and wont come off with isopropyl alcohol. What can I do? Will re-waxing it help?

10.5 Salomon Launch Boots fit into M bindings?,"Beginner, looking to stop renting this season. I found a fantastic deal on a used board + bindings (2019 Pulse + Unknown Salomon bindings for $120) but this means I get my boots last.

Used gear question,"I'm getting back into snowboarding after 10+ years

I'm going to buy used. I have 2 options.

1. 2006 burton custom wit p1 HD bindings. I know it's old but the guy only rode it about 5 times. It's a 156. He's selling it for $125


2. 2015 Yes The Public. Burton cartel bindings. 154cm. Good condition. Selling for $150

I'm 6'1 155 pounds. 

I know the custom is a good all mountain, but should I be worried about its age? 

The yes is more of a park board, which I'm down with as I like to hit some jumps and rails, but will it be alright carving? 

The custom would make more sense for my riding style, but I'm not sure how well they age.

Whistler or Breck area ( Xmas - NY) ??,"EPIC pass holder here from the Southeast. Planning a group trip Dec 26(ish) - 3 Jan. The final two destinations in contention are Whistler or Breck (and surrounding mtns via rental  ). Sorry Utah /Cali /Terons/San Juan's will have to wait till prime season. Just so ya know :

- I've been to both
- Intermediate rider. Prefer pow and groomers. No Park
- Airfare &amp; Lodging Prices are a slight influence but not deal breaker. 

Big ticket items that weigh heavily : 
-%% of terrain open 
-Lesser crowds. Yes I know it's holidays! 
-Best snowmaking covg 

Looking at weather models , webcams etc , Whistler has gotten off to a warm and slow start and plan to open just after Thanksgiving. Which is standard. Mid Nov into Dec is their prime wet period. In past, I've seen village all rain and pow in alpine in early season. I haven't seen them making snow and Temps have been marginal for snowmaking - low to upper 30s. 

Colo has gotten off to a quick start from recent storms with established base &amp; top to bottom runs but single digit % of trails open. It's been dry of late but the 7+ day models are finally suggesting the high pressure Ridge will finally budge which could open the storm door for both regions. 

So, Crystal Ball prediction time, assuming we get past this current dry spell, which resort historically can rapidly get more trails and *bowls* open &amp; establish a bigger base come Christmas? Would like to book by the wknd!

Bindings for Libtech Rocket,"So I am intermediate snowboarder, being going every winter for the past 8-9 years. Love going out on fresh powdery days (who doesn't), or otherwise just cruise on groomers and hit little bumps here and there, too old to be hitting the park hardcore.

I have been surfing my whole life so I got this board to try to see if it does feel like surfing a little bit more.  


Now, the problem I have is that my current boots are pretty soft, and I was wondering which bindings to get, nothing ultra stiff since I want a little bit more forgiveness, would getting a binding on the 5-6 stiffness scale be pretty bad for this board with soft boots?

"I am trying to decide between a Burton Process, Custom, or Custom X!","Hi everyone! Im looking for some advice and would really appreciate any help. If this is the wrong place please let me know where’s better to ask. I’m looking into buying a new board this season and have been looking into the three boards listed in the title. A little about me, I’m 28 years old, 5’10, 160ish pounds, very athletic, and coming from a 2013 Burton Process with Genesis EST Bindings. I’m a high intermediate, mostly all mountain rider, riding in the icy conditions of Northeastern Pennsylvania, but also making trips out west every so often. I enjoy hard charging the mountain, with lots of speed, but also enjoy having a board that also has play to it. While I do enjoy hitting jumps in the park, I would definitely say it’s a 75-25 split between all mountain riding-and park. Really I’m looking for one all-mountain board that can really handle everything no matter what I throw at it. I really like the Custom (I figured I fall between a 154 or 156), and this may be so ridiculous, but it drives me slightly insane that the color in this seasons offerings switch from a mean Black and a Red theme in the 154 to a Teal and Black in the 156. If this is a dumb reason not to pick a board, I just need to hear someone say it. Any advice would seriously be greatly appreciated as I just bought an Ikon Pass for the season and really want to pull the trigger on this before my birthday on the 18th.

Moved from Burton Moto's to Swath,"I've recently upgraded from a pair of Burton Moto's to the (step on) Swaths.

The Moto's were the first pair of boots I owned and when I got them I was convinced they were too tight...but I had them heat moulded and after only a few hours riding I ended up putting in volume reducers as they were actually too loose!

So this time round, I went 0.5 of a size smaller (the volume reducers were for 0.5 of a size), however I haven't had them heat moulded, have just been walking around the house for about 10 hours in total.

They do feel very tight, but when I take the liners out there is absolutely loads of room in the boot, however the liner itself feels very tight. My big toe is touching the end and forces the shape of the liner out a fraction where it touches (if that makes sense).

My foot doesn't get numb as such, but it does feel a bit squashed right at the end (on the plus side I get virtually zero heel lift)!

Mondo size wise, I've got the right boots and I suspect once worn in they will be fine, but I just wondered if anyone else has moved from the Moto's to the Swath's and whether they thought the sizing was similar?

Its obviously impossible to be sure, but I can't remember exactly how the 'padding out' process felt last time, so not entirely sure if the squashing sensation I'm getting is similar or not.

My guess is that sizing up 0.5 would probably be a bad idea, but just wanted some validation really, that I should be okay in a few weeks (and hopefully others might find the description of the 'padding out' process useful if they're going through the same thing).

I know there are loads of similar threads, but was hoping there would be someone else out there that has moved specifically from the Moto's to the Swaths!",snowboarding,1573238766,new_user_99,True,2019-11-08,0

Right now I use a Ride 2012 buck wild, so coming from a stiffer all mountain twin I kind of want to change that up a bit to maybe something easier to control and a little more flex.

One month left or how to spend the entire season on the mountain working/boarding,"So as the title says, I have exactly one month left before I retreat to my winter cabin for the season.

All boards are waxed and tuned, all gear is already hauled up there and I've spent the last weekend there chopping up firewood so I have enough until January. 

This is the first year since I've started working in IT(usually worked for other companies so I could only get in 2-3 weeks of riding total, now I'm a private consultant of sorts) that I'm going to spend the entire season above 2000m :D

So, I've set up my work so that I will have time from 8am-4pm for riding(or 5:30am-12pm if I go splitboarding), and then work from 6pm-midnight. I will try to ride every day, but I guess there will be days I will work the entire day. I have a couple of friends in the resort and my girlfriend and best friends will be coming and going through the season.

So if there is someone who already spent a season in the mountains riding and working, are there any tips in the balance of two? You do not need to work in IT, anything goes except working a mountain specific job(instructing, lift-work, shaping, etc)...

Ride Insano or Burton Ion?!,"I am buying new boots this year since the foam padding in my 14 year-old pair is (literally) starting to decompose. I’ve been riding for about 16 years now in Utah (shoutout to Snowbird) and am a terrain junkie. Nothing makes me happier than some vert or tree runs on a power day, or booking it down groomers when the snow is packed. Park is not my thing, nor is “taking it easy”.

Given my affinity for tree runs, fast riding, and the such, I’m looking to get some pretty stiff boots. After trying a bunch on, I’ve narrowed it down to Ride Insano and Burton Ion. They both are comfy (Ion maybe slightly more, but I’m not too worried since they will both be heat molded anyway). Insano is a little more stiff. But honestly, trying them on in a ski shop only gives a glimpse as to how I’ll like them on the mountain. At this point, it seems likes it’s come down to splitting hairs.

I am 5'11"" 190lbs but would prefer a board that is shorter, 156-157 vs. 160 (recommended most of the times because of my weight), that just seemed big to me in the store though.

Looking to round out my quiver with a Freestyle board and need suggestions!,"What’s up y’all?

I’m primarily an All Mountain rider, but hope to dabble in some park and hit more natural features this coming season after a few years of sporadic snowboarding when I had moved farther away from my mountain (and was a broke college student).

I currently have a SickStick, an Omni, and a Berzerker. All of them lean more towards that free ride/all mountain style. 

I’m looking for a board that can handle itself well in the park on jumps and jibs, but that can also tear up the mountain all around. I don’t expect it to be a great powder board, but I have the SickStick and Omni for those days. 

I don’t expect to ever really spend a full day in the park. If anything, it’d be closer to a max of like 40% of a day in. So it’s important to have a board that still handles itself outside of jumping and jibbing. I also love to ride switch, even if my boards haven’t been the best for it. So added bonus points if it’s close to a twin.

I’m thinking about the Disruptor. I like what Signal is doing, but also because I’ve heard nothing but great things about the board and it seems to be a good fit for what I’m searching for.

Snowboard recommendation for the East Coast this 2019/2020,"Hi Everybody.

The snow is slowly approaching, can feel it in the air already.

I live in CT, so often I go to Hunter (Upstate NY), Mount Snow (VT) or NH but not that often.

The snow here is different here from back home (Los Andes in Chile), more like slushy on warm days, or essential icy most of the time. Powder days are rare all over the season and most of the time we hit, hard snow or even icy.

Last year I rode these conditions on a Lib Tech Skate Banana, which was fine, but when you don't wanna spend time in the park, believe there are better options.

This year, I'll face the same conditions again, and thus, I'm after a snowboard that I can go fast, especially on groomed runs, maintain the balance, but also been able to move around and do some short tricks and jumps.

No interested in Park, BackCountry, or glades.

I wud say I'm an intermediate rider, budged around USD 500.

Will really appreciate some tips here.

Unsure of the 'type' of board I should go for,"The wife offered to buy me a new snowboard for Christmas. I've been riding a  Capita ""Get Rich or Die Trying"" for around 5 years. The thing is yellow (bought it used) and I'd just like something new since she's offering.

My style: Intermediate/Ultimate Kook. I like to pretend to surf frontside down the mountain.  Light carves, check turns, blow tails (in surfing language) and spraying are what I really enjoy. I'll be honest, between a job and only having so much paid time off I'm worried of getting a dedicated powder board ...unless there's one that rides well on groomers and does what I enjoy the most.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question is, should I just aim for an all-mountain board since I'm more likely to end up on groomer days just looking for hips/banks to spray? Are carving boards built for a faux-surfer?

I'm more of a snowboarder that loves to do flat tricks, butters, etc., I don't necessarily go on parks but will occasionally go off a jump and don't like to go ""too fast"". 

I've narrowed it down to three boards but can't seem to make a decision and would love to get some second opinions.

Normally, I ride in Arizona with an annual trip somewhere in Colorado. I was thinking of getting the Feelgood Flying V, but I read that it doesn’t perform well in icy conditions.

Free Ride Board - Rossignol XV vs. Yes PYL,"What's up guys. So I am looking at a new Freeride board.  I've been snowboarding for a while but have finally determined my preferred riding style, have outgrown my old gear, and can finally afford to upgrade.

Looking for opnion on my broken Burton bindings,"Hi Everyone,

I read up on Burton's warranty and I'm over the 1year mark, but I started to read on the limited lifetime warranty and it covers the base plate. Does anyone have experience? My online research basicily tells me that people have generally good experiences and etc. The experiences that others spoke about were equipment used hard. I like the part of the limited lifetime warranty on how it's evaluated on how much time it had, not how old it is.

What happened is the last time I went snowboarding I purchased two new bindings after my trip. They are the Cartels and Triads. They have 0 hours and have been at home the entire time and since I finally saved up enough to make a journey to Japan this year to go snowboarding, I thought to take them out to inspect them. They looked totally brand new and as soon as I touched it and unfolded the bindings into place they fell apart. I know they aren't literally brand new at this point, but they don't have any time on it.

I was tempted to stress test it out on my board, but I'm not sure if I should try and just call Burton about it first before I break it more. I just am not sure what I should do as I'm torn and upset on the situation because the trip is costing a really hefty amount already and renting gear up there is not something I want to do. Part of me wishes I never bought bindings, to begin with, but I was trying to be proactive for the next season. I feel like I need a win from Burton right now. For those wondering about the condition, it has the weird discoloration and stickiness to it. I'm guessing it's due to where I live unlike someone who lives in Colorado would never experience with these plastics. On the straps, the majority of the material flaked off and a lot of the plastic pieces broke.

I was tempted to stress test it out on my board, but I'm not sure if I should try and just call Burton about it first. I just am not sure what I should do as I'm torn and upset on the situation because the trip is costing a really hefty amount already and renting up there does not offer good gear.

I am a 20 year old 5’4 female at 135 pounds and I’m an intermediate going into advanced rider. 

I would like to know what board would be in my best interest. 
I want to rip in the park as well as be able to go in the powder without a problem. 

The boards I’m in between are the 2019/2020 Capita paradise or the 2019/2020 RIDE compact. 
 
The Capita is a versatile true twin while the ride is a directional. 

Do any women or men have any advice? I heard the ride compact is a little slow and a little too wide to do some carves on.

Planning a Japan trip and would love to hear your stories and advice!,"Hi r/snowbarding! I've been a long time lurker and decided to post as I am planning snowboarding trip to Japan and hoping to get some help/tips/advice from this awesome community. I'll be booking my trip for Early February and have +/- 3 weeks allocated. I'd like to explore the traditional Japanese cities - hit up Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo while also spending at least a week and a half in Hokkaido.

&amp;#x200B;

Me -

This is really my third actual season snowboarding but after getting the bug 3 years ago, I've logged roughly 50 days per season and consider myself comfortable on black diamond runs. From the PNW and have only ridden PNW snow - Baker, Whistler, and local Vancouver mountains. I'll be doing my AST-1 training this season and have slowly acquired most of my backcountry gear over the past few years. That said, I'll be going to Japan alone and unless I meet some experienced riders who are down to explore, I don't plan on doing any backcountry. 

&amp;#x200B;

Gear -

Two boards - a 153 libtech trice pro and a 159 libtech splitbrd.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions -

1. I'll be flying out of Vancouver. I'm not really sure what makes sense from a cost savings perspective considering that I'd like to spend time exploring Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo but also get to ride the legendary snow in Hokkaido. Any pacific northwest folks that have done a trip with similar intentions of 50% sightseeing and 50% riding? Would love to hear about past experiences, what you loved and what you would have done differently!
2. Gear - does it make sense to bring my own gear and travel with it/store it somewhere or should I rent there?
3. Resorts/backcountry/meetups - As I mentioned, I'm comfortable on black diamond runs. Any thoughts on what resorts/areas would be worth visiting? Also, I'm not sure what the riding community is like in Japan but it'd be sweet to meet up with some fellow shredders there and explore together!

I feel like I should have more questions but I'll start here for now. Would love to get a discussion going and learn from all of you. Thank you for taking the time to read and respond :)",snowboarding,1572415501,Pitsbits,True,2019-10-30,0

Board type idea/question,"I ride in the northeast mostly.  It's mostly icy crap snow if I'm being honest, but occasionally we get a bit of powder and it's glorious.  For the week or so after that good powder dump the trees are fun.  Lots of fun.  But as the week progresses, if no new snow comes, it turn back into ""scrapey"" ice.  

Would it make sense to have a short, fat, and cambered board for such conditions?  It makes sense to me, but maybe I'm missing something.  Short and fat to be nimble in the trees and fun when it's powder.  Camber when the powder goes away and you need a real edge.  The board would benefit from being stiff also.

Going to breck with 7 of my buddies this January - Rental advice needed,"New to this Reddit everyone, so if I'm missing anything please bare with me.  
We are stoked to be able to hit the mountains for the second year in a row. But we remember from last year (Copper Mountain) that the rental boards were super heavy, super wide, and super stiff. I even asked for a better board and was quickly told that all boards at the resort rental shop are the same and that there will be no performance difference.   


I would call myself more of an intermediate rider even though I've only rode for a total of maybe 14 days on the mountain my whole life. I picked it up fairly quickly and was able to hit small jumps and boxes. I'm really only interested in riding the park/terrain areas now. I'm curious to know, what's the best rental board for me to seek out? (If anyone has any suggestions for a place in Breckenridge, CO please lmk) And also, should I look for specific aspects to make park riding most enjoyable? Again, the hotel rental seemed super heavy and super wide.

Anyone using the Snowboard Addiction training boards/system?,"I'd take any thoughts on the training boards, etc. Also, if it's good, I'd take some thoughts as to whether I should get a tramp board or the jib board. I'm coming off a knee injury (just a sprain although with knees ""just a sprain"" still sucks) and just trying to do some training to get ready for the season. 

In reading about the training boards, the tramp board is recommended for most, it seems. But, I don't really intend to use it on a trampoline but rather for balance and rail training. For that, it would seem that the jib board would be the better choice (albeit quite a bit more difficult).

Best resorts/mountains on the west coast U.S. that are easy to get to from the airport?,"Looking to take a group boarding trip somewhere in early December.

Another factor I want to take into account - which resorts/mountains generally have the best conditions in early December? We would normally do Big Bear for something like this, but it might be a little early in the season to go there. Mammoth might be an option (since we can just make the drive), but it'll depend on how much snow they get by then.

Specific New Board Advice: All-mountain freestyle.,"Hey, so I've been boarding for a few years, but sadly only a few times each season, so progress has been slow.   
The only board I've owned is my ""2011 Salomon Drift Rocker 154cm"".   
I'm debating getting a new board this season, but having only ever ridden this one board, I'm not sure exactly what I need. But I'll try to outline my specifics below.   


\- I'm a fairly light guy; 65kg (143 pounds), 178cm (5' 8"") without gear.   
\- Current goals: improving switch, butter tricks, small jump tricks.  
\- Not really trying to do massive jumps anytime soon.   
\- Not really into going super fast.   
\- I like powder, but rarely get to experience it.   
\- I live in Japan, so gear choices might be a bit different. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm ""intermediate"". Pretty confident going down the mountain.   
I've always just been trying tricks off of natural features. Haven't had the confidence to get into the park much yet, since they usually seem to have really advanced features, and big jumps where I am...   
I would like to give it a try this season though. 

I want a versatile board that I can take all over the mountain, and start doing some park tricks with.   
I guess a softer board would be good for me given my weight and goals?   


Oh, and the most important thing;  
I want a board with a nice natural wooden or bamboo finish, or failing that, some tasteful artwork. Not really a fan of most of the crazy vomit-color graphics I see with skulls and flying pigs.

Snowboard for a new rider that won’t be outgrown fast?,"I’m a new rider and eager to get my first board, BUT I’m concerned a lot of the recommended “beginner boards” are ones that I would outgrow before long.

How to tune a board for glacial snowboarding?,"I've been snowboarding (freestyle) weekly for about a year now, but I've only snowboarded indoor. I'm advancing fast, but I still have a lot to learn.
My friend convinced me to join him next week to go to Zermatt. Since it's still not really the season, it'll be on the (summer) glacier part of Zermatt.
Since this is my first experience ever outdoor. I was wondering what kind of tuning I should do (apart from a good proper hot wax) before going.
I do the waxing myself but I'm planning to go to the shop to get my board tuned.
My first board I used a lot in the park, so I lightly detuned the edges for rail features. I also give them a rub from time to time with a stone to remove the rust and burrs. 

Recently I got a more park oriented board (also slightly detuned that one), so my plan is to re-tune my first board to have a sharper edge as a playful(!) board that can carve a little bit.

I suppose there will be a lot of icy spots on the glacier piste? If I bring my board to the shop (again, not my new park board, but my old one), what kind of tuning should I request? Just sharpen the edges? Should I consider different bevel angles (don't know what angle it is now, just factory edge tune (1/1??))?
Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Also, aside from that I was wondering when one would consider a base grind for his or her snowboard? Should it be done often? I have no idea about this. I read there are different kinds of 'structures' to grind? 
I have some scratches and minor dents but nothing that's bothering me. Would it be worth it getting a base grind?

Buying my first snowboard. Camber or Rocker?,"Hello reddit! I've been snowboarding for 4 years, 2-3 times per year, but last year I went on the mountain 7 times. This year I really want to snowboard even more, and a friend of mine does as well, so I'm thinking about buying my own equipment instead of renting.  


I visited my local board shop, and the dude there was really helpful and explained everything very well. I told him I want a board that will last me through my progression, and not something that I'll outgrow this or the next year. He suggested a Burton Process, which is a nice medium board, and after reading some reviews online I think I'll go with his suggestion.  


My only problem is that he suggests the Flying V board, and I've been reading about Camber and Rocker, and I think that camber would fit me better, even if it will take me a little bit more practise to get used to the ""less forgiving"" board. I think that progressing on a camber board will be better for me in the long run.  


What do you guys think? Should I follow my ""internet research"" and get the camber board, or should I follow the board store guy's advice and go with the Flying V?

Old Shredder Gear decision PT 2... Huge upgrades but Burton Only,"Hi all, 

2nd post to the group.

Im 48, doing an entire gear upgrade.  I have to use Burton because I have a substantial discount code for this season.  

I'm committed to getting the new step in system because I am old and creeky and don't want to fight with boots and bindings any longer

I'm now looking at boards...  and wow there are alot of choices.

Currently between 150-155lbs size 8 boot and a whopping 5'6""

Target Terrain:  All mountain, Trees, Powder and a few Colorado CAT trips.

Local Mountain:  Snowbowl/Sunrise AZ

Im looking for a new board that might be easy on the knees in normal packed conditions.  Im leaning toward the Custom Camber for the responsive carving and pop.  That being said, the sizes for me range from 150-154.  With the new tech is 150 going to limit me in the Pow?seems like it would be easy to slightly set the stance back but that still doesnt seem like alot of board to work with.

Used vs. New(er) Boards,"Hi all!

I’m relatively new to snowboarding, but really became set on getting old last season. I finally live in an area where I can go regularly come winter, and bought a solid first set of gear for a crazy good deal.

Looking back, I felt that my board was quite big for me, despite it being in the range of what I should get for my weight (175-180lbs with a 155cm board), and want to get into something new. 

What is the general feel for getting used boards? Has board technology progressed so ki has that its worth getting a newer board? I’ve surfed my whole life and know that, I’m general, getting a used surfboard is totally fine as the tech has evolved, but not in ways that the average surfer would really notice. Thought on snowboards? I came across this cheap deal locally - 

https://washingtondc.craigslist.org/nva/spo/7003991395.html

Gear Advice - Arbor Element Rocker,"I'm a beginner to intermediate rider who’s looking to get a new board after riding on a 5150 Vice camber board for five years. I broke my collarbone in two places at the start of last season after catching an edge, so I’m looking at rocker boards to try to avoid that as much as possible. My riding consists almost entirely of cruising on groomed runs without an emphasis on tricks in the park. 

Right now, I’m looking at the Arbor Element Rocker 2020 (155cm) with Arbor Hemlock Bindings and older Vans Encore Boots. Can I get some advice on if this is a good pick for my style? Any experiences on the Element Rocker are appreciated as well.

Buying my first board. Totally lost and could use some help.,"I've been boarding for years, but have always rented gear and just take what they give me at the ski shop. Looking to buy everything this year and could use some board recommendations.

* 5'10 and weigh around 185lbs (in the process of dropping to around 175lbs, if that matters)

* Intermediate skill level. Can carve pretty well, comfortable at relatively high speeds, and can hit smaller jumps/rails

* Mainly run at resorts in California (Big Bear, Mammoth - but want to start making trips farther out to other mountains across the country) and like running all-mountain. Usually on groomers, some trees, and a little bit of park. Would like to become adequate in all areas

* Rarely ride switch, but would like to get better at it

* Budget $500-700, but is flexible

* Looking for an all-mountain kind of board I guess? Idk, could use some help

Since the season is about to really get going (I live in CO for reference), I was looking to get a new board.

From what I've seen is that it even though it's pretty stiff, it's still maneuverable and a really solid all-mountain board. I spend most of my time in the trees and more difficult terrain.

Is snowboarding like riding a Carver?,"Hi everyone,

I just now bought a plane ticket to Breckenridge, Co. in December. I will be going with some family friends but I have **NEVER** seen snow or even snowboarded. I live in florida and I can surf but I do skate (I do more skating than surfing). I usually ride a [penny board](https://www.pennyskateboards.com/) around campus to get to classes and stuff like that. However, I can ride a [Carver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpRdgjp2EVI) which has super loose trucks to allow you to carve back and forth to keep your momentum so you don't have to push to keep moving. I plan to snowboard when I am up in Co. because I've been told it is similar to both surfing and skating. Can anyone attest to this or give me rationale as to why  trying to snowboard first is maybe not the best idea? I really want to enjoy my time up there as I am paying this and it was something I saved up for for then entirety of summer.

Board sizing - Importance of effective edge?,"So I’m looking at a few new boards this season. Currently I ride a rome reverb rocker in 154 and according to the specs, this has an effective edge of 121cm.

I’ve been looking at downsizing to a smaller board - 152ish since I think I’d be happier on it for more freestyle/park mixed in with general all mountain stuff.

Here’s the thing though, on the proto type 2 for example, the effective edge on a 152 is 117cm which is “effectively” 4cm shorter than my current board right? A Yes Greats in 151 has a 111cm EE, which is 10cm less than my current board. That seems pretty significant, no?  Am I overthinking this?

I guess what I’m wondering is how much I should take effective edge into consideration when choosing a board size. Not sure if it even makes sense to do that if every manufacturer measures it differently or if it’s skewed by other variables. Any thoughts?

For reference, I’m 5’9, 150lbs, size 9 boot.",snowboarding,1571592460,dumpler,True,2019-10-20,0
Snowboard Repair How To / Follow Up,"[Link to repair pictures and process](https://imgur.com/a/6YT0Upm)

\*PM if you have legit questions\*

Initial Notes:

Posted a picture of a snowboard I have with a busted core that have previously been ""fixed"" at a local shop. Most people told me my board was toast...casuals from TX (JK no idea just teasing) So I decided to fix it, here are my results/ process. 

Materials:

\-Snowboard (broken)

\-Clamps

\-Small pieces of wood or sturdy flat objects i.e. metal scraps, drink coasters, whatever 

\-JBWeld Marine Weld (Not sponsored I spent \~$16 for a tube) There is also different waterproof epoxies out there for cheaper or even puddys and not glue. Just want waterproof and a hella lot of PSI strength 

\-Tape, I used painters, but anything to keep the epoxy off the base of the board 

\-Dremel/ Sandpaper (Anything to sand down the hardened epoxy)

Steps:

1. Tape off your damaged area i.e. put tape around that sucker 
2. Clean up the damaged area, use some water, soap and just clean and dry it so the epoxy bonds well
3. Get your epoxy/puddy ready to jam into the board 
4. Jam as much epoxy as you can into your board. This is where a good tape job is important. Stuff that turkey like it's thanksgiving
5. Let set for 15min (MarineWelds set time) before putting on the wood and clamps. This is so you don't have your wood bond to your board. (Set time vs Cure time)
6. After the epoxy is set, put your pieces of wood, metal, flat object on each side of the board and clamp them down over the epoxy. Make sure those clamps are tight. 
7. Let epoxy cure (MarineWelds cure time is 16-24 hours)
8. After cure, determine if you need more epoxy to level off the base of your board, if so repeat sets 4-7. You want the epoxy to be a little higher than the base of the board so you can sand down and get a smooth surface. (I had to add 2 layers of epoxy, since my base damage was deep)
9. Begin to sand down and smooth the hardened epoxy until flush with the board base.
10. Brush off epoxy dust, wipe down with a cloth and your ready to shred 

Results:

It took me \~72hrs to complete the repair, with most of the time waiting for it to cure. I had to add two layers of epoxy i.e. had to repeat steps 4-7 twice. Before, I could flex my board and see the board layers, now, when I flex the board feels solid and epoxy holds well. 

Math for all the haters that say it wont work: MarineWeld can hold up to 3200PSI, the dimensions of cracked board were roughly 0.25""x2.25"". Thus I have a damaged area of 0.625in\^2 --&gt; 0.625\*3200=2000Lbs. So if MarineWeld works as advertised the crack should be able to withstand 2000lbs of force, which is a lot.

Snowboarding and herniated disc.,"Hello wonderful community of /r/snowboarding. I have a question and I am really sorry if this is not the place to ask.

So 2 days ago i was diagnosticated with a herniated disc L5-S1. I have been having terrible pain on my right foot since a week ago. I am under some mild pain-killers and I have had all the medical investigations so far. My doctor's opinion for the moment is that I should start Physical therapy, as he thinks there's no need for surgery.

From what I've understood, there's a pretty big chance of recovery for this, but it crushed me thinking I may never get to snowboard again. After a search on the internet I've found people return to sports after recovering from this.

Injuries report of Japanese ski resorts in 2018-2019 season,"There is an organization in Japan which collect injuries data from various ski resorts since 1998.

http://www.nikokyo.or.jp/safety-snow/index1.html

Here is the quick summary. If you are going to visit Japan in the next season, you may find it interesting.

- Injuries rate is 0.0136% for snowboard, 0.0096% for ski. In 1998-1999 season snowboard was 2.5 times more dangerous than ski. It has been improving ever since.
- Injuries numbers peaked at 11 AM and 14 PM. It just reflect the population due to the lunch break. Weather, sex and age are also looks list just showing the population.
- Injured body parts: For snowboarders, it used to be wrist fracture or dislocation are the biggest, but the recent seasons, shoulder dislocation is the most major injuries. The report don't consider the cause of this. Perhaps, more people are wearing the wrist protector these days?
- Most injuries are cause by self falling.
- Skier collide with other skiers and snowboarders almost 50:50, but snowboarders are 23:75. More likely to collide with other snowboarders. I wonder why.
- While riding lift, I can't stop thinking about falling off from the chair, but such incident are pretty rare.
- 43.2% skiers wear helmet. 22.9% snowboarders wear helmet. This data doesn't match with my gut feeling. Japanese helmet wearing rate is so low. My gut feeling is less than 5%. Perhaps, it's foreigners who increase the rate. I usually go to the not internationally famous ski area(I always wear helmet.)
- 2017-2018 season report mentions about alcohol consumption rate of injured person. It was 2.2%. I can't understand Ski resorts sell alcohols to the skiers/snowboarders. Is foreign(non-Japanese) ski resorts are also like that?",snowboarding,1570975570,ezoe,True,2019-10-13,0

Some question for my first season.,"I'm about to start my first snowboarding season and when purchasing my pass it gives me the option of including season rentals for an extra 170$ this is just for the board and bindings though no helmet or boots.  Should I get this or just buy a snowboard?  Will the rental boards be as good as I would get for an entry level snowboard?

I was also looking at helmets and found oakley mod 5 helmets in the unpopular colors for about 120$ which seems to be around the price of most mips helmets in finding and I'm not picky about colors is this a good deal or should I go for different ones?

For the goggles.  I noticed they have removable lens for different lighting.  I will be snowboarding both at night and in the day will just getting one clear lens for night and one for bright daylight be enough for starting?  What should I look for in goggles and are there any recomended brands?

For the snowboard I wanted one that would be good for resort riding plus with the option of taking it park as I start to get better.  Would a true twin or a directional twin be better for me?  I found a DC space echo on sale for 254 at 158cm and a Smokin Team Series Colin Snowboard for 309 at 159cm.  Would these be good?  They are both true twins?  Are there any other recomendations?  There is also the K2 Snowboards Joy Driver for 329 at 159cm which is a directional and the DC Supernatant for 249 at 158cm which is a directional board.

What should I look for when it comes to boots and bindings?  I am a US size 11 male if they makes a difference?

"First time snowboarding, working a snow season in Japan (HELP!!!)","So I have a year out between uni and I thought the best use of my time would be to set out to the powdery slopes of Japan to snowboard (and ski) for a solid 5 months for a snow season. I've never actually skied or snowboarded before but I skateboard (well, pennyboard) and I've surfed before (but never actually stood up). So I'm basically closing my eyes stepping into japan and hoping I dont break a leg or hate it and stuff.

So a bit of background on what I'll be doing: I'm going to be in Niseko, in the north of Japan where I'll be working in a hotel for 40 hours a week during the day, so I wont have much time out there on the slopes but I assume I'll just snowboard around my working times. I looked it up and I think they have night skiing from 16:30 to 20:00 so I'm all down for skiing at night. I know that working at night would be better in terms of snowboard time but this job paid the best and moneys a big factor for me bc I'm a broke student heh. I do get 2 days off a week so will fully commit them to hitting the slopes. 

I've done a bit of reading on how to prepare but would rly love some advise for those of you out there who are willing to share some wisdom, so would anyone be willing to give advise on these factors plus anything else they want to share bc I rly rly need some guidance. I'm mainly keen on snowboarding but given that I'll be there for a solid 5 months I'm also down for learning skiing as well so any information on both would be dope!

1) What do I wear? Even the most obvious things like a shirt or underwear please give me details!!! I've been looking at ski jackets but idk whether it can be any jacket i have lying around in my wardrobe or whether they have to be a specific type? Any recommendations would be amazing! And cheap places to get. I am one of those people who do value quality over price so if theres an expensive but amazing jacket out there that is perfect for snowboarding/skiing I'm 100% down to buy. 

2) Buy or rent? Now normally I'd go straight for renting because I dont know what board or skis would be right for me but since I'm committed for staying for 5 months I think buying the equipment would be more worth. I'm more leaning towards buying but I dont wanna get ahead of myself so if I am please hold me back! But if I were to buy a snowboard (or skis) what would ya'll recommend considering I'm a beginner? Also bearing in mind that I'll (hopefully) get pretty good at it near the end so should I get more intermediate/advanced level boards? 

3) Ski lessons. I'm definitely going to get them, in fact as many as I need, but my main problem is timing. As I said I'm working 40 hours a week but because the hotel I'm working at is newly built they havent exactly set up their working times so I dont know when I'll be free exactly. I asked the dude at the interview and he said everything is a bit uncertain right now so he cant confirm anything. So I was wondering whether its possible to just walk in and ask if theres ski lessons on that day or the next day and work around my job.

4) The peeps. So I never did something as radical as move from one country to another before on my own and making friends is something I sometimes struggle with. I'm quite extroverted at home but if I'm in a situation where I know nobody and everyone knows each other already I tend to internalise. So I was wondering whether there are any other solo skiers my age or how likely it is to find people just like me. How do you find these people?!?!?!?

5) Money? So I'm getting paid in japanese yen but all my banks will operate in GBP. Is there any way I can get a japanese bank account? I heard it's a bit hard to open one if you're not Japanese but I don't really know how to work around it. I have some bank accounts (Monzo and Starling bank) where I can spend money with pounds and itll convert to another currency for free. Would that be ok to get my wages in or should I use smt else?

6) Ski/snowboarding qualifications. So this is assuming I can pick it up quite fast. I'm hoping that I can get the qualification while I'm there and teach it towards the end of the season for some extra cash (again, I'm super broke). Would it be possible to train up as an instructor or do you have to book in advance? How soon can I get the qualification and how awesome do I have to be at snowboarding? 

7) Extra jobs. Is there a possibility to pick up other jobs while I'm there? I'm currently working in a bar, nothing fancy just pouring pints and g&amp;t's. I'm thinking of getting a weekend bartending job but am not sure how likely I'm to get it? Again, getting a teaching qualification would be great, but am not sure if anywhere will take me on mid-season.

Online there is still stock so I could exchange if I had to.

What do people here usually run?

This is my second pair of hand protection, the first being Aldi winter gear sale (Aussies and Brits will know) which were okay for an intro pair, but i needed something a bit... A LOT more waterproof as I use them much more frequently now in Vancouver.

Beginner using a stiff board?,"Hope it's alright if I post this here. I went on a skiing trip last year and learnt how to snowboard on a rental. Fell in love with it, and managed to go down medium-hard-level slopes w/ proper turning techniques and all. So this year, I bought a used snowboard in preparation for the trip for really cheap. The board has the same shape as beginner boards, right length for me (according to an online sizing chart), it came with bindings installed, with just a minor scratch on the underside. Basically, I thought I found the greatest possible deal and took it.

When I got home though, I noticed that it's stiffer than what I remember my board felt like last year, so I read online and it seems that beginners should use softer boards, and I think this one is kinda stiff. AFAIK from what I read, this just makes turning harder, which I'm willing to endure (for the price).

However, I wanna know, how much harder should I expect turning to be with a stiffer board? Will it be almost impossible? Should I try and return the board and resume the search for a more appropriate stiffness board?

TL;DR bought a stiff board as a beginner bc I'm a noob and got dazzled by price, how much harder will it be for me to use it?

New board halp!,"Hey all!

I've decided to get a new board for myself this year but making a choice is damn near impossible. I've been riding for three years now and finally started to really find my style last year. Generally I ride pretty hard and I love to bounce in and out of trees and hit the bowls on snowy days. I tend to stay off the groomers after the first couple warm-up runs. For example I spent probably half the season last year up on Panorama/the Cirque at Winter Park and in the Copper Bowl. I'm 6' and 190 riding Colorado 99% of the time. I also use Katanas with Tactical ADV boots, I plan to keep that setup for as long as they hold up after spending all of last season experimenting. My current board is a NS PTT which I'll keep,  I'm after a more aggressive daily driver to complement the NS (I don't swap boards throughout the day typically though, I'll pick one and go all day).

I found some solid local deals on last year's models of the Capita BSOD and Mercury as well as the Slash ATV. I'm completely torn. I feel like the BSOD would fit the kind of riding I like to do but I've seen a lot anecdotal evidence as to their durability. I manage to find quite a few trees throughout the year. I've also always been curious about a traditional camber board and the Slash probably fits the Colorado weather the best, it doesn't dump here quite like it does out west but I think I'd want something I really love when we do get the freeride days you daydream about. Finally I've never heard anything except positives from the Mercury but I feel like it might be pretty similar to my NS.

Halp kick my unsure ass in a direction! I'm going to pull the trigger on one while there are still some boards in stock and demo others throughout the year if I can to be sure I made the right choice.

Seeking Freestlye Carving Board,"Hi!

This post is more refined in terms of what I want, but here's the rundown:
I'm 5""8 and 155lb, and run mainly ski resorts and parks in California. Standard, left foot in front. I would like to say I'm intermediate(?); can carve comfortably but not perfectly and will bite the snow at times. Endgoal obviously is to perfect carving. Main priority is a board with an emphasis on carving and speed going down slopes, yet open to doing small ramps and railings for longer term goals. Budget is painfully $500 (ideally $400), though if you make a strong case will consider going higher.

I assume you constantly stay on an edge but it's about finding the optimal amount of time on an edge before switching to the other, otherwise you would end up carving?  
How much pressure should be on an edge to improve speed?  
Keep knees bent?  
Should you ever not be on an edge? Whenever I'm snowboarding I'm never not on an edge because I feel it's so easy to fall over if you hit something you aren't expecting

Is this right? Do you have any other tips on how to maximise speed?",snowboarding,1570486544,griblygook,True,2019-10-07,0

* Facebook page
* Facebook group
* Instagram page - I’ll post a featured product, eg “clothes swap of the week”.

Advice for new boards for 2020,"I'm an advanced rider who until last year had been riding a Nitro board I bought in 2001.

Should I go bigger on the Headspace? Given reviews looks like the Magic Carpet should be sized down a bit, but I don't wanna go too small since I'll use it for pow.  Given how new I am to purchasing boards in general, I don't really know what makes a board ride smaller/larger so any help on that would be appreciated.

360 degree steel edges vs. Mervin boards,"I’ve heard different opinions on the design of Mervin boards. 

People who like it argue that not having a 360 degree steel edge makes it easier to repair. 

  - this is questionable to me. I don’t see how it makes it easier to repair. If the nose is blown up, (I’m not talking about delamination, delam is easier to repair regardless), how is a Mervin board easier to repair? Is the repair process different from other boards? my understanding is that if you have a big broken nose (let’s say a big crack because you hit a tree), it’s basically irreparable in either case unless replace the entire top sheet or base. 

People don’t like it argue that not having 360 steel edge makes the board less durable and Mervin’s easy repair argument is simply a marketing hoax, in reality, it is a intentional design to save cost. 
- I do think it makes the board much less durable, but can you really save a lot of money by not wrapping the  steel edge bit more ? A snowboard is already pretty expensive ($599 for a good board?), probably priced way above its cost. And I don’t think the snowboard community is that price sensitive.

Anybody have K2 Clickers? How do they perform?,"Back in the mid–late '90s when I used to snowboard, I always saw a few people running the K2 clickers. I'm thinking about getting back into snowboarding and wanted to try out the clickers this time around. It seems like I'd be able to click in as soon as I get off the lift and start going down the mountains, which is a lot more convenient than strapping the bindings on.

The main difference I see is that it doesn't have the back support for the boots, nor can you adjust the tightness of the straps, or lack thereof, so I'm wondering how  maneuverability of the board is with them. I am also having a hard time finding the Compass Clickers in my size men's 6 (out of stock everywhere).

Opinion on FLOW bindings for I intermediate park riding,"Hey all...

So this season is a big one for me. My goal is to start getting into bigger jumps and rails while getting more consistent with my spins. I'd also like to go for a backie this season.

Currently I've got a 6 year old pair of flow bindings that I'm riding on and I'm worried about the safety of them when it comes to hitting bigger features. The high backs come unclipped pretty easily and my foot has popped out the back a couple times when hitting features. Has anyone experienced similar issues with Flow bindings when it comes to park? I got these when I was more of a beginner and it seems they're really meant for convenience not taking a beating. Are newer flow bindings more reliable?

GNU Money as a beginner board?,"I am a starting snowboarder. I am going to take a course to learn the basics in 7 weeks. I came across the GNU Money board which I can buy for only €210,-

I know it is not the ultimate beginner board, but from what I can tell (from reviews and breakdowns online) it's a good all-mountain board for beginners to intermediate riders.

One salesman I asked advice from told me the magnetraction would be the fun killer and make me wipe out too much. He said the flex was kind of okay for a beginner but there were a lot of other boards which would make for better beginner boards. Another saleswoman told me it would be okay to start with this board but it would make the learning a bit tough and maybe a bit slower, but I would enjoy it in the long run.

My question is; will this board be okay for a beginner snowboarder or will it slow me down learning to snowboard to the point that it will not be fun?

Does snowboard size really make much of a difference?,"I was looking over the Capita size chart, and it says going by my weight I can ride anywhere from a 147 to a 157. That's only 3.97 inches different, so a 157 would have about 2 inches more on the nose and tail compared to a 147.

Honestly, is that even noticeable? I'm 5'8"" and weigh 140 lbs. I got the Capita Horrorscope and really just want it to be a fun butter machine. I got the 153, but should I return for one shorter? Or longer?

I have a hard time believing it could make much of a difference, especially since I got the 153 which splits the difference. I've only ever ridden two boards so maybe you guys with deeper quivers can help me out.",snowboarding,1569916578,adamcognac,True,2019-10-01,0

I feel like I've progressed from beginner to intermediate. Is it time to upgrade my setup?,"Hey guys,

Just finished up my snow season here in Australia and I'd say my skill level is the low end of intermediate. This was the first year I was able to really progress my riding. I got 7 full days of riding in the season (previously only had 3 days spread over a 3-4 year period), hoping to do at least twice that much next year!

I'm starting to wonder if it's time to take advantage of end of season sales and upgrade my gear.

I'm a 5'6"" 63kg female, I don't ride park (yet) and my current setup consists of:

[2017 Rome Royal 144cm board](https://www.evo.com/outlet/snowboards/rome-royal-snowboard-womens-2017)

2016 Burton Lexa Bindings

2016 Ride Harper boots

The only problem that I've noticed now that I'm improving is that my boots are too soft. They were great for my first 4 or 5 days of riding but now I feel like they're not responsive enough. My feet don't feel like an extension of the board. My current boots have a flex rating 3, I was thinking of upgrading to the [2018 DC Search boots](https://www.melbournesnowboard.com.au/products/dc-search-2018?variant=8131916005495)

 which have a flex rating of 6. Would they be a good choice. 

As for the rest of my setup...staff members at two reputable competing stores in my area have said my setup is great but according to everything I've read online it's all wrong haha

I do need a shortish board because Australian conditions are pretty icey...but is 144cm too short? Guy at my local store said I'd have trouble controlling a longer one. I was thinking it might be beneficial to upgrade to something a little bit longer...146cm-147cm? I currently have my eye on the 146cm version of [this](http://www.romesnowboards.com/boards/lo-fi-rocker/)

I'm also worried about the disparity in flex between my boarding and bindings. I'm not 100% sure but I *think* my board is a 4 and my bindings are an 8. Again the people at my local stores have assured me everything is fine and the only problem I've actually noticed myself is boot stiffness. I'm just confused because I'm getting so much conflicting information. Hope you guys are able to help.

PNW boarding road trip advice,"This winter probably around late January or early February I was planning on making a solo road trip up to the PNW from California for a boarding trip.  As of right now I don’t have anything mapped out except for possibly spending one weekend in Seattle with a family member (and enjoying a hot shower or two) 
I will be traveling by myself and have been really entertaining the idea of camping out in the back seat of my truck. It has a bed cover so storing boards, ice chest with food/water, camp grill for breakfast and lunch would be pretty easy. Then buying an air mattress for the back seat of my truck that has plenty of room (2018 4door f150).

The questions I have are mostly centered around mountains to hit and logistics. I usually ride 15-20 days a year. Enjoy powder and off piste when it’s available. No park for me.  I usually ride the most at the resorts in central California but get a few days in Tahoe every year. 

I have a powder alliance pass so was looking into whitepass and mission ridge for the budget minded days. Then was thinking about dropping into mt hood meadows for the experience of it. The other option was going to mt hood meadows first then 3-4 days in Washington then over to Idaho for bogus basin and possibly over to Montana to whitefish or big sky. Any other mountain recommendations are appreciated! All in all I’m looking for 7-10 days total trip time. 

As far as showering and facilities has anyone  done anything like this before? Do you just hit up truck stops along the way? Do the guys living out of vans just take baby wipe showers? Would a -20* sleeping bag be over kill? I know whitepass has an RV lot that I could camp out in but do any other mountains offer something similar? 

Any help would be appreciated or if anyone wants someone to shred in the PNW I’ll let you know when I’m coming through the area!",snowboarding,1570075899,DatCowGuy,True,2019-10-03,0
Need gear advice,"I'm still pretty new to snowboarding but I love it a lot. I've taken it up as my new passion. I have a back ground of surfing experience as well skateboarding and wake boarding. But now I'm in the north west I've found myself in the mountains which I absolutely love if anyone's curious.

Im about 6'3"" 175 pounds with a shoe size of 12 (more like 11 and a half but I like to round up). Pretty skinny if I'm being fair. I usually just rent stuff but I want to get myself a set of equipment to save money on them slopes.
I'm definitely past beginner. Day two ever snowboarding I was already doing single diamonds. But I'm no expert. I have a lot of learning but my style is a nice clean rocker with camber (like I know what that means) but I have a brief understanding. Mainly! I just enjoy carving the most and something that can handle corners as well some park. A do it all if you will but more on the side of carving.

Big key here fellas reading I don't want to spend a whole lot of money. Little is best. Something budget. I'd love for any recommendations! Like I said already I don't have the money to buy good equipment because I'd be going to the resorts maybe 10 times in a givin season. Probably more the following because I'd have the gear already.

Beginner --&gt; Intermediate Seeking Advice,"Hey guys,

Following post will be a little lengthy, any advice is appreciated. 

New to boarding, did all of three days worth in Japan in February, absolutely frothed it and have just bought tickets to Canada for a Month at the start of next year. Looking to purchase snow gear here in Brisbane or when we land in Vancouver and would appreciate advice on the following points.

Firstly, is it worth buying second hand? If not, any store recommendations/online vendors?

Any specific board recommendations. I'm sure we're classed as beginners currently, however picked things up in Japan relatively quickly. Was comfortably sending it down intermediate runs by the end of the three days. Would prefer start on a board out of my skill level and grow into it over the month rather than growing out of a beginner board. Would also be good to be able to utilise it after the trip too!

Lastly, if there are any wicked accommodation options that would suit 3 Aussies looking to party and board for a month on Whistler, throw em out!

Breckenridge Trail Suggestions (Beginner/Intermediate),"Going to Breck for the first time in late February with wife and another couple. Other couple is a snowboarder and skier both beginner, me and my wife are intermediate snowboarder and skier. Being from Louisiana we go on a trip once a year, we are not very good.

We like spaced out trees, nothing to tight. I’d say the main thing is finding some runs I can do all day and play with side hits and some trees. We usually go to steamboat so an example of what we are looking for is something like the backside of steamboat or the right side blues at steamboat.

"Next Board, Stuck on a few choices!","Hi All!

I'm in minds between three boards and want your opinions.

1. Jones Ultra Mountain Twin
2. Capita Mercury
3. YES Standard

I currently ride a Jones Mountain Twin, and thanks to the idiots at Jetstar, now have to replace it! I love the aggression, but wondering if an Ultra Mountain Twin will be too much?  


The, the other boards I know have similar profiles etc, but any perks/cons on any of these boards? I'd be buying brand new 2020 models.... The only one that is standing out is the YES due to the slamback setting which would make it fun for powder.  


I am an intermediate rider, blues and blacks are ok, but still learning. No double blacks, minimal off-piste riding. Small park. I'm female, \~80kg and 177cm/5'10"" tall. Main mountains are in Australia, and I'm about to go spend 3 months in Japan (Madarao). 

I'd also like advice on size.... my current Mountain Twin is 154cm. I recently rode a Camber Burton Feel Good at 152 and it felt good. People who are suggesting the YES Standard are suggesting a 151 will be ok - I worry it's going to be a little on the shorter side for me? Although I plan to use it in Japan, so maybe shorter for powder is ok? How would this translate on a groomer, having such a short board when I'm a little tall...?

Does anyone have a 2019 GNU Forest Bailey Space Case snowboard ? Would love to hear some feedback.,"I’m primarily looking to buy an all mountain board with following requirements. 

- works well all mountain, an all around board, and good in all conditions (east coast and Utah), so I don’t really need a powder specific board 
- sintered base. 
- Medium to stiffer flex because I don’t want to feel everything under my board. And the terrain I ride usually have big piles of snow. 
- 147cm is probably the ideal length of the board . 149/150 is likely  pushing the limit but that was based on my experience with rental boards
- I prefer a camber dominant profile
- stable 


I came across FB space case. It looks like a good option based on people’s reviews on YouTube. 

What I’m not sure is 
1). If it works well all mountain 
2). if it’s too soft and at stability 
3). I read somewhere the laminate comes off not sure if it should be a concern [Space Case 2018 review ](https://skijudge.com/gnu-space-case-snowboard-review/). I know the review was for 2018 but it seems little had changed.

Help Choosing a snowboard. And bindings/boots if possible,"Hi all! I'll introduce my background so that you get an idea of what I'm looking for.

I'm a native Californian who rides mainly parks, some that may have nice powder while others close to shaved ice. I'm 5""8 and 155lb so that'd make my board siZe 156. Standard, left foot in front.

Snowboarding newbie gear recommendation,"Sorry to add another post asking about gear recommendation but here I go :D

**My level of snowboarding:**

I'm a total beginner. My first time being on a snowboard was last year December. I got a day (2hr) of 1:1 lesson in Korea (where I am from, though I live in Australia). Since then, I practiced what I have learnt from the lesson at Mt Buller, Melbourne. By the end of the lesson, I just finished learning Novice turn and moved onto carving. When I was practicing by myself, I felt like I knew how to engage edge but like... Idk So yeah! that is my skill level, total noob :D

**Questions for you guys!!!**

**1) My first question is**; Do you guys think that it is worth for me to buy full set of boots+board+binding? I was planning on buying snow jacket and pants + extra stuff (goggles, gloves etc) since a full set costs ALOT of money :( I just thought that it may be a bit early for me to drop so much money (it will be so much including boots+Board+binding with the rest) when I'm only snowboarding like 10 days max. Maybe I should buy my first board when I go snowboarding more often?? What are your honest opinions!?

**2) Second question is;** Is there some of the brands/features I should be looking for in a snow jacket/pants?? I have been looking around quite a bit but I see so many features and tech that I can't understand... I understand higher number=better for water proofing but the rest is just too much @-@... Any brand you guys recommend? and why?!

**3) Third and last (YAY! finally) question is;** IF I was to buy a board+binding+boots. What would you guys recommend? I asked around and one of my friend said that I should get something that is in the ""middle"". Like a board with mid-flex and traditional camber (he said that this was ""basic"", because it was the standard for many years before other types were invented). He said this considering I'm only a beginner trying out stuff, therefore I shouldn't really lean towards any style and stay in the ""middle ground"". 

However, when I looked around (literally everywhere), it seemed like 90% of the people out there was recommending rather softer boards (around 2-4/10) with Rocker/Reversed camber (which is the opposite to what my friend recommened). That left me quite confused.  Anyhow, since I enjoy feeling the breeze and speed + half of the time I will be riding in Korea (which doesn't have very good snow quality), I'm looking for boards that lean towards ""freeriding""...

As for binding and bootss

Never take this sport for granted,"Hey guys,

Winter is coming and I hope you can all take some turns for me. Looks like I will have to miss this season from an injury I had at the end of last season. I knuckled the 3rd booter in the Dark Territory park at Winter Park and got a nice “LisFranc” fracture in my left foot. Six months later it looks like I am going to have to skip out this season if I want to ride the rest of my life. Ive always tried to push through pain and keep going, but this time I need to be smart. Honestly Im really sad that I wont be out boarding, and even more sad that Im not anywhere near the mountains.

 I love this sport so much. I love everything about it. I love how it makes winter a bright and fun place, where for most people (who don’t snowboard) it can be dark and melancholy. I love the people I meet through snowboarding. Its such a unique community of people you run into on the mountain. I meet all sorts of types of people. There are pro athletes, stoners, businessmen, children, college chicks, church groups, resort employees, families and lots of people who play as hard as they work. We are all there to have a good time, to get better, and because we want to be here instead of anywhere else. Most of the people are intentionally in that long line.

The feeling of landing a trick, or a line of tricks is the most satisfying sensation I have ever felt. This sport helps me overcome fear through learning how to calculate and prepare. But its also a creative outlet. Sometimes I wonder.... is this a sport? Or am I doing some kind of performance art? I just feels so damn good I don’t care what it is.

 This sport makes me want to take care of both my physical and mental health. I care more about what happens off snow as well because it manifests into me having really good performance. All facets of life play into how well you ride, instead of the vice versa. 

I love feeling connected to nature and the environment. Its already so important to be outdoors in the winter.  I love having to deal with the changing conditions. My appreciation for nature has only grown as I have spent more time on the mountain. Please don’t leave trash out there. Please. 

I have so much appreciation for the people who build really high level parks. These guys work really hard for such perfection. And if you ride a park that isn’t perfect, i encourage you to talk to the shapers. Sometimes they need input, and its their job to make a park that people want to ride. 

Some people don’t want to ride less than ideal conditions but I cannot spoil myself with that. You can ALWAYS find something rideable and I encourage you to try out all genres and disciplines within snowboarding. If you are a powder person, go try out a box. If you are a park guy, go follow some people down some steeps and see how well you really think you hang.

I love when something awesome happens and I end up giggling uncontrollably. I love the feeling of landing something i used to think was scary, but now it feels safe and effortless. There are all these aspects that play into the sport that I will always be extending my knowledge on. 

Please guys just do not take this for granted. You are so lucky. I will be back out there, and its funny how it feels like it will be forever. Just be careful, especially you guys riding big park and backcountry. Its easy to get ahead of yourself and find yourself with a boneheaded injury or in a shitty situation. You can go far this season without getting carried away (literally or figuratively). Let your resort staff know that you appreciate them. Everyone from ski patrol, to lifties, rentals, park crew, instructors, snowmaking. It takes an army of people and some of those jobs are not easy at all. And most of them are underpaid and not in good living conditions to be out there because they LOVE it.    Ive dedicated a lot of time to riding in Colorado and its an amazing place for snowboarding. If you are lucky enough to ride in top level mountains on a season pass. Please take full advantage and make carves for the people who aren’t as lucky to be there. This sport is so much more than the gear you have or how cool you look. Those things are bonus points. Try something new this year. Take someone snowboarding who has never been before. Find someone knowledgeable about backcountry. If you are in the states, drive across the country to ride out west. Talk to the stranger on the chair. Get lots of footage. Scare yourself once a day. Learn to enjoy falling. Remember why you started and kept on going. Be safe.

Wax Advice!! Getting ready for the season,"Hello all,


   I’m getting ready for riding season and I need your advice.  I’ve just spent the past hour and half doing more research.  I used Demon all temp wax last season and did not feel like it worked as well Id like so this year I’ve gone with Hertel Race Wax (all temp)-it got amazing reviews.  I ride warmer temps in California (mammoth) as well as cold, negative temps in the mornings/days at Jackson Hole.  I’m thinking more of JH because that’s the trip I enjoy most, but I’m worried that since Hertel race wax is rated to only go down to 6F, those cold rides in JH at -10 could be problematic.  

Is there some sort of additive or spray-on wax I can use to just improve that super cold weather performance? 

I like the simplicity of all weather wax because I don’t want to have to try to predict mountain conditions for specific temp wax.  I was just wondering what you guys thought!

Burton Genesis vs Jones Apollo (ADVICE),"Hey guys and girls,

I’m looking to purchase new bindings this year for my 2020 Jones Flagship. I’ve typically ridden Burton boards in the past however I decided to pick up a Jones Flagship after demoing one last year for a week.

I need new bindings for the board. I always ride Burton Genesis EST’s or X’s. I try to ride back country, powder days and as much fresh snow as I can. I try not to ride groomers at all. I ride a Burton Ion boot in the full grain leather (Red Wing) if it matters. 

If anyone has ridden the high end Jones binding and the Burton Genesis X’s or Malvita’s, I’d love to hear your opinion on them all. I tried talking to the my local shop but they’re very biased towards Burton.

Stomped! - Check out my Snowboarding Game,"Let me introduce you guys to my new iOS/Android game Stomped!

![img](zj0di3wwfkp31 ""throw down some powdersurf inspired moves!"")

I grew up playing TonyHawk, 1080 and SSX. Living in the UK there were no mountains for me to snowboard, so I mainly skated and played with computers. I was able to get out to the Alps a few times, but it wasn't until I moved to Cali and had the amazing (and small) Mountain High and Big Bear as my locals that I was able to really get my shred on.

I've always been interested in Powder Surfing, it's too crazy difficult for me, but the style and potential inspired the design of ***Stomped!*** I love how you can not only throw down on the classics tricks, but also throw in some skateboarding tricks too. I'd probably die if I tried it in real life.

The flow, the feel, the difficulty, is something I really wanted to get right in this game. Something with a learning curve and depth, that really rewards re-playability. ^(It's no School2, but maybe one day it could be)

There's something just right about linking together a combo and stomping it clean!

This game took me forever (years!!) to make, and is pretty *niche*! If you do get a chance to take a look I would love to have your feedback and support! *^(Even an upvote, share or comment on this post helps support more snowboarding games!)*

It would be amazing to be able to work on a sequel, up the quality and make it even more legit. *Support is much appreciated!*

I'll be at Mountain High all season, if my knees can take it!

High Fives and see ya all there! :)

 Also any adivce on whether that is a good board to grow with or not, board recommendations, or anything else will help.

I will be boarding on the westcoast of BC, probably not whistler so lots of wetter snow, and i plan on riding park, groomers and off the trail as i progress.

"Hey Shredders, give me your personal intermediate progression advice!"," 

Hi everyone,

Backstory: 25 now and have been snowboarding a few times a year since I was a kid. Last year spent my first season in a hill town and got out much more (close to 30 days).  This year spending the winter again in a hill town.

Goal: I want to dive as deep as I can and improve my ability to hit air/tricks and work up to back country runs. Along with improving my switch riding.

I also enjoy making and editing videos and would love to put together a minute edit at the end of the season.

Current ability: 

\-I try to go off little ledges where I can find them on runs and practice getting small amounts of air.

\-I am able to take tree lines between groomed runs comfortably.

\-I am able to tail press at about a novice level and working on nose presses

\-I can handle green, blue, and black runs

Questions: In general does anyone have advice on how to advance in the best fashion? (videos, channels, progression methodology/techniques)

Side Idea: If there is any interest, start a weekly thread with video footage and review for working on a skill/trick.

Much Thanks!",snowboarding,1569347568,I_PUT_HATS_ON_DOGS,True,2019-09-24,0

To spin Frontside from your heels off a park jump, drop in and line up a toe edge setup carve, with the left side of the jump. Roll to your heel edge as you go up the transition, preparing to pop off the lip. Try to time your set up carves, so your board is leaving the lip in a straight direction. To spin backside off a park jump, drop in and line up a heel edge setup carve with the right side of the jump. Roll onto your toe edge as you go up the transition, getting ready to pop from your toe edge. These two entry paths are the exact opposite, which is why you sometimes see an hour glass shape being formed on the run in of park jumps.

Stroking out,"When ever i go and ride (so far only happens at Park City in Utah) I will, as my friends put it ""Stroke Out"". My speech will become slurred, I get a lot of blind spots in my vision, numbness in my left hand, nauseous and will normally throw up at the end of it all. I can normally sleep it off and I'll recover but it would be great to not get that way in the first place as this makes it really dangerous to get down the hill and driving home. 

This usually happens after I've been riding for a good 5-6 hours. I can put in that much time at any other resort and nothing will happen. I bring and drink plenty of water the night before I hit the lift and while out and about. I eat well before I get out there and bring some of those protein packs to snack on too.  i also pop some Ibuprofen as well.  

Like I said, its only happened while at Park City. Alot of people will probably say I'm not use to the altitude but after going to Park 6 times last season, it happened 5 out 6 times.  A buddy recommended that I get those Boost Oxygen cans and I might.

Upgrading my 2012-13 Jones Flagship - advice welcome,"Hi all - 

I have a 2012-13 Jones Flagship that has seen decent use over the past 6-7 seasons that is still in decent shape - the base is hanging in there and the edges could use some work - but I'm wondering if I should upgrade my board to something new this season, or just save the money and ride what I currently have? Has build/design tech progressed significantly enough since 2012 to warrant a new deck?

For some background, I live close to Crystal Mountain in Washington and currently planning to buy the Ikon pass for this season.

Opinion for ski slope in Tohoku region(JP) with tree rides allowed,"Hi folks,

Next season is coming, n i already secured my flight tix for late Jan 😁💪

I have been to (near Tohoku region):

\- Zao Onsen Yamagata

\- Mt Jeans Tochigi

\- Kusatsu Kokusai Gunma

\- Nozawa Onsen

\- Hakuba Tsugaike n HappoOne

&amp;#x200B;

I will be visiting some friends in Tochigi for few days and plan to go up north, so i wont be heading Nagano side.

Originally i plan to visit AppiKogen, but I read that that resort bans off piste. As of Hakkoda its a real risky due to slope positioning facing strong winds exposure that can make resort shut down the lifts.

&amp;#x200B;

Any recommendations of other resorts that allows off piste, is easily accessible via public transport n not crowded? I can either stay near mountain, or pick a big town nearby n commute via bus daily.

Anyone know a good communicator / intercom / walkie system for helmet?,"(I -think- I read the rules right that these kind of posts go outside of the discussion threads during off season?)

I'm finally getting back to the slopes after several years of not having the budget for it.  Always wished I had a better way of talking to my friends while on the slope, since it gets tricky to get someone's attention once they start moving.

I've found a few comm options so far, but they all seem kind of questionable...  Anyone have experience with one that works well?

I want to spend money on a good set, preferably one that still works when the mountain doesn't have cell service.  $300 per set is fine if they work well, especially if I get good audio quality out of it for music.

In particular I'm wondering,

1. For the ones that use cellular data to communicate, do those stop working if the mountain has no cell tower, or are they able to talk to each other directly within a certain range?
2. Are there any that work wireless, or integrate within just the helmet?
3. Does music actually work with good quality and play nice with the comms, or should I not even bother trying?  (I'm aware of Bluetooth limitations here, my sensibilities say it would not work unless wired.)
4. I've seen some that advertise being able to share music tracks.  Does that actually work, or is it like playing music through a phone?  (i.e. technically works, but garbage)",snowboarding,1568682103,squirrelpotpie,True,2019-09-16,0

Advice needed for new shred stick,"After a lifetime of hand-me-downs and Craigslist scores, I finally have enough to buy a NEW deck! 

Because of this, I am way out of the game for new decks and the tech that's out there. I've really only ridden one model for the past 10 years, Rome's Agent rocker 156. I have 4 decks of this model, and two of the agent before rocker tech was even invented lol. They are all destroyed because ""shred or die"" is life. 

I looking for something similar, an all mountain deck that can rip steep chutes, float in pow but still be fun in the park. I don't need a true-twin shape but definitely don't want a directional.

Looking for freeride-ish recommendations,"Hey!

I hope it's cool to just ask for recommendations for this upcoming season.    


I am a moderate/advanced free-ride oriented rider that has to deal with what ever conditions I get dealt with my one week per yer at resorts (Snowbird, Vail, etc).  I have been riding a busted, old GNU Carbon HiBeam with bust old boots since I was 15/16 (31 now).  I think it is time for a replacement.

I love tree lines and hunting powder.  Moguls/bumps and traverses and out of bounds riding is all that I focus on.  I don't care at all about park riding, jibbing, etc. 

I really want something that does everything well but focuses on powder, trees and moguls and just general off-piste stuff.  Despite focusing on those priorities, I also want something that is at least competent on groomers as well.

I don't care so much about bombing groomers at high speed.  I care about being able to ride complicated terrain and having fun doing it.

With all that, any board recommendations?  I am also picking up bindings and boots so recommendations there would also be greatly appreciated.

Having gone down a week long rabbit whole of catching up to speed on 15 years of snowboard technology, I am considering a Ride Mtnpig, but wonder if there are any other recommendations that match my riding M.O. better.

Best Snowboard bindings regardless of price,"Hi guys.

Im looking for a new set of bindings, I originally started riding on the Burton Mission est bindings not knowing its stiffness at all.  During a NZ snowboard trip in queenstown, I tried a rental board and used burton cartel bindings and found them really responsive for the type of riding I like.
I found it easier to initiate turns and I didnt have to work as hard with the softer flexing Mission ones I had.

-If price was no issue what bindings would you suggest? (All brands)
-Currently have a 2020 ride superpig and planning on buying a Burton Custom x flying V soon.

The type of riding Im into atm is mostly groomed runs, carving hard and off track stuff at the remarkables NZ where you walk to the top (not splitboarding) and snowboard through ice and powder stashes.

Late Feb. 2020 Trip Advice,"Hey all, we're looking to do a 3-4 day (4-5 night) trip this winter. Two of us will be riding, one will not be riding or skiing. I'm looking at Big Sky and Utah. The ""we"" who are riding are 10 and 53 years of age, this will be our 5th season. We can comfortably handle blacks in Minnesota (yeah, I know). Two years ago we did Vail and were able to do most of it. That said, I think out west, we both mostly enjoy long blues, glades, bowls. 

Big Sky looks awesome, though I have read that it really doesn't have a lot of those blue-to-black nice intermediate runs. But, of course, that could be wrong. It also looks like there might not be much to do for the non-rider/skiier in the group. Frankly, I was thinking of Whitefish too, but someone we know who goes to Montana a lot said Big Sky is a ""much better mountain.""

For Utah, I'm really curious about Powder Mountain (seems like the antithesis of Vail, which would make it more our speed). Snowbasin is also near, but I really know very little about that place. The other option would be to locate ourselves near little conttonwood and likely focus on Brighton, with the option of a longer drive one day up towards Powder Mountain.

Need snowboard boot advice - Pain in the forefoot after the first few runs of the day,"Hey all, I have a pair of Ride Anthems that I purchased in 2015 and I have always had intermittent issues with pain in my foot. I always just took it as something that was normal and just something I had to deal with. 

Recently over the last year or two it's been hurting more frequently. The pain is the worst at the very start of the day after a few runs and it's only my left foot (I ride natural). My right foot has never had issues with pain. The pain is localised around the forefoot area/ball of my foot. I've tried starting off the day tightened normally and a little bit loose...sometimes it helps but most of the time it's the same pain regardless.

Any ideas? Could the boot be too small? Should I try insoles? How much lift should I generally be getting with the back of my foot if I stand up on my toes?",snowboarding,1568252208,Sh1FTy,True,2019-09-11,0

I currently ride a 150cm lib-tech T-Rice pro from 3 or so years ago. and wear a 9-9.5 boot. I am thinking I will bump up to 152 cm for my split. Is that a good idea?

No Style -The loss of Style in snowboarding,"This is an article I wrote earlier in the year, and forgot about. I thought I'd share it with you guys and see what you think. Now remember this is my opinion, thats all:

  

No Style

The loss of Style in snowboarding

&amp;#x200B;

It’s become boring hasn’t it? It’s the same tricks, the same ridiculous tricks, the same… everything. Everything I love about snowboarding is coming crashing down. I fell in love with snowboarding because, it’s beautiful, it’s an art form. To me, and possibliy to many others, snowboarding is way of expression, it’s a way of telling people who they are and quite frankly, snowboarding’s just cool. And we’ve lost that expression, that coolness, in competitive snowboarding.

I think that snowboarding should go back to its roots, where it all began, at least in terms of freestyle anyways. It all started with kids making videos to share with their friends. All it was, was kid’s trying to look cool and have fun with their friends. Now that is cool, cause it’s just hanging out with your mates. The moment it becomes super competitive, the moment you push the possibilities of what the human can do, it’s no longer cool. You’ve taken the magic out of the kid’s hands. It’s like If the Patriots turned up to your flag football tournament. There’s no point playing anymore, cause you’re never going to be as good as them. And that’s the problem, it’s just not right to have such a divide between good riders and the greats, especially in a sport where it’s all about style, all about the artistic approach, all about the fun of the sport. 

We’ve lost the coolness, and the factor of expression from snowboarding because everything has to be **BIG**. It was cool cause it used to be tricks any kid could see on film, pick up a board and give it ago. But know, everything’s just, so much bigger man. It’s ridiculous. Like I look up to Sandbech, or McMorris but what they do is out of this world compared to any normal snowboarder. Man, just take a look at this 2019’s X Games slopestyle event: McMorris on the final run of the contest gets a score of 96.00. That’s a damn good score and I’m not taking anything away from McMorris but on the final big kickers, he pulled a 1260 with some grab, a 1440 with another grab and a 1600 I think with another different grab. And I think this is where the problem lies. Even just after watching his run to write this article I cannot for the love of me remember his final 3 tricks properly. It’s become way too confusing for people to watch and to take in. An incredible feat definitely, but it’s not the nicest thing to watch either. It’ just too complex, too quick and too confusing to get your head around.

The big air is definitely another criminal in the loss of coolness in snowboarding. Everything has to be big, has to be complicated has to be quote on quote “awe-inspiring”. This is the event where it is expected that nobody can do what the riders can. If I’m a 15-year-old kid watching the X Games and I see Takeru Otsuka pull a front side 1800 to grab gold, there is no way I’m thinking I can do that, cause I can hardly understand what he’s just done. That’s the problem, everything is just too complex to properly understand, and then it just doesn’t make it cool. You take anything in life, science or politics or whatever. From the outside looking in on some complex bit of physics or some inexplainable trade agreement, we don’t think that’s cool, cause we don’t understand it. You ask the physicists what they think about their complex theory, they think it’s the coolest thing in the world cause they understand it. Snowboarding has become like physics. Only the really good, accomplished physicists understand and come up with complex theories, and only really good accomplished snowboarders pull off outrageous tricks. Us commoners are left to confused and demotivated. Not only that but the majority of us, don’t have access to these massive jumps to even consider practicing these ridiculous tricks on. So the best our sport can show us, give to us is inaccessible to the rest of the world. That’s like some oligarchy type crap happening and that for sure is not cool.

But don’t worry yet. There’s is a glimmer of hope. The Knuckle Huck. Oh my. Oh my. Was this a breath of fresh air. An event that wasn’t solely based on how skilled you were, not based on how good a gymnast you are, not based on how many rotations you could do in a second. An event judged on style. Style. STYLE! Finally. Something where the riders show off stuff that is recognizable, understandable and memorable. Where we can turn to our mates a say “Hell yeah I can do that”. We have all seen a knuckle huck before, all it is, is a lip. It’s the brow of a hill. It’s a slight roller. Every resort has one, every single resort. It’s so familiar to all of us. It’s something that every rider enjoys. A small pop. A grab here. A slow 360 there. Just a nice controlled 180. That’s what The Knuckle Huck is. It’s like being out with your mates again, and one by one riding this lip. Just taking off and trying to have a fun time. You saw the competitors just having fun, I mean look at Judd Henkes, doing the belly slide. He was just having fun, and that’s what snowboarding’s all about. And that’s why the Knuckle is a step in the right direction, in returning snowboarding to a cool steezy sport.

And let’s not forget the Van’s Hi-Standard Series right? No rotations over 720? Check. No inversions? Check. Is style everything? YES! This is personally my favorite competition going. It has all age categories, and promotes simple, stylish and steezy tricks. It promotes going out with your friends to the park, just to have fun. Yeah there’s a small cash prize. But that’s not the main aim. The main aim is to go out and just to have fun, and try new stuff, stuff that is accomplishable to normal riders. That is the essence of snowboarding. Trying new stuff, with mates that isn’t super complex but just looks cool. That’s all it is. And that’s what competitive snowboarding like the X games is beginning to lose. No longer is about the normal rider. Its only about the elite, and I think that this causes a loss in snowboarding, cause you to lose the sense of riding with pals and just having fun. 

So I say, bring back the fun times, the times where snowboarding was an art form, a joy to watch rather than something complex to try and wrap your head around. Bring back the times where you watched pros ride and thought you become one of the. Bring back the times where it was just about having fun with your mates

Need help choosing a Utah Season Pass,"Hi Utah shreddit,

I already posted this over in r/SaltLakeCity, but figure some of you folks have some snowboard specific wisdom I could glean:

Hey folks!

I know you get a ton of these posts but I have read them all and am still stuck/have more questions.

I am new to the area. This will be my first Utah ski season and I need to buy a pass before prices jump. I am currently torn between Brighton, Snowbasin, and Park City. I would consider myself intermediate, don’t have much need to do crazy double blacks yet so I excluded Snowbird.

I live on the north side of the city and am equidistant (as far as google maps goes) from Basin and Brighton. Going to Brighton I would ride the UTA from the park n’ ride. Is there an eyeball estimate of how long this would take on a typical weekend? I have heard only horror stories of traffic up the canyon.

My dislike of traffic leads me to basin/park city. I also like these options because they are bigger. My drawback with them though is that they get like 150” less snow on average. Is this significant enough for me to eat the extra hours stuck on the bus and stuck in lift lines?

I have heard Brighton has a cool snowboard culture. I don’t ride park at all yet. Just blue cruisers and tree runs. So Brighton’s small size gets smaller when I don’t use the park sections.

Please help if y’all can. The cost difference isn’t too much of an issue here. Basin and Brighton are the same roughly and Park city is a couple hundred more - another potential dealbreaker.

I wish there was a pass that would let me try all of them and then settle on a season pass at whichever one I liked the most. This far out with this little knowledge of the area it feels like a gamble.

Burton 2020 AK Swash,"Well done Burton!!!

I saw the white/green jacket an insta-bought it the other day. I didn't even notice the differences until I got home, so for everyone that gives a shit about gear...

1. Mesh-lined pit vents!
About fucking time! I was considering switching brands (not really) because of how annoying it is to drop +$500 on a jacket that lacks such a useful feature!

2. Heavy-duty wipers!
For the last several models: Stagger to all Swash variants, the main zipper felt weak and did not justify the price, until now! The zipper is over 0.5CM wide, made of aluminum, and ""feels"" fucking good! Never going to deal with liner getting caught in the zipper again - I can tell.

3. Insulated phone pocket
Holy shit - finally! Sure, a super-dry pocket is nice, but batteries get destroyed in &lt;-15 weather. This is a sick fucking upgrade.

4. Full-hand liners!
No more will a velcro-infused wrist skirt be a bitch to take on/off the coat! They finally put this in the coat!

My next board,"Hey everyone,

So this is going to be my third season. I've progressed very fast. So far I've ridden on a Step Child deck in the parks of Carinthia and loved it for rails and small kickers. That was my friends though and I could only borrow it for a few months so for this season I rode a Capita: Scott Stevens Pro, and a Capita: Defender of Awesome. My experience on the Steven was that it was a lot of fun for smaller more playful stylish riding but not for going into any actual kickers or super gnarly rails. I actually ended up learning how to back flip during my second season, which ended up being the cause of a fracture in front of my hind binding in the midsection. My Defender of Awesome board has treated me well but while learning to Tame Dog I cracked the tail and am now worried about integrity of it. I also had a crazy girl I was talking to smash the nose and delam it but I got it fixed. However the screws are all stripping, and I have my bindings on by luck so it's time to upgrade. I just spent a summer working at Woodward Tahoe and now have the confidence and know how to throw at least Cork 9's, double backflips, and other various 'large' tricks and plan on taking on over sized features this season.

Best ski resorts/towns to work in?,"If I should post this elsewhere just kindly let me know!

Hey! I'm looking for advice on what life is like working at Park City resort and Aspen Snowmass and being in those towns!

I've been traveling a lot so I'm looking for

2. A place with more things to do, I am afraid of feeling trapped in a place that only has a ski resort. Also serves as a backdrop if I want to be able to find another job
3. Overall generally a fun place where it's easy to meet people and the job is chill (If the town is great but everyone working at the resort is pretentious or cliquey then I don't want that)

I chose rental technician over other jobs because I want to learn something (tuning/fitting) and applying to resorts is easier since they hire very early (right now!). I'm open to not working at a resort but seems the easiest to get my foot into a new area.

So I currently ride a 158Wide Burton 2015 Custom Flying V and love it. its just been the most fun board, the only major drawback is I've wanted to look at getting a lighter board. I used to be quite a bit heavier and have since lost a fair bit of weight and wanting something a little more light. 

Any suggestions? Also would love to try a shorter board, maybe a 156 or shorter. It all has to obviously work around my US 13 boot.

Epic or Peak pass for east coast riders,"So with Vail announcing they are buying peak, almost all mountains near me would be covered under the epic pass, making getting that a no-brainer.

Also, chat on their site is saying that if the deal with peak falls through, they won't issue a refund, even though they won't be able to fulfill giving access to peak resorts, which honestly seems like a fucked up stance for a business to take.

Is it bad form to adjust my binding angles from slightly duck to slightly forward to keep my weight centred?,"Is it bad form to achieve a “centrered” weight by adjusting the binding angle? 

Basically, i have collapsed feet arches and have knock knees (genu valgum) where my feet are far apart when knees are touching and the patella part of my knee is facing outward. I have been having trouble having a more centred weight balance on my snowboard and have found even just standing on flat ground i tend to lean on my right/rear (dominant) foot more for stability. 

However i tried adjusting my rear binding to a positive 6 (was negative 6 earlier) and it felt way more comfortable. I havent tested it on snow yet but just trying to drive my front foot on the ground to turn felt way more natural and comfortable. This obviously may change when i test on snow of course but my thinking behind this is that i felt more centred with this angle. 

I am currently a beginner-intermediate level rider and i understand that learning switch is important however i was having trouble with my weight balance last time i went out and think this may help to at least progress to be a more confident rider first with good weight balance. Please give me your opinions on this.

Recommended budget freeride board that'll float in Japow?,"Hey everyone, got a good 3-4 months to go 'til the season starts here in Japan and I'm looking to upgrade my equipment (board). Can you guys please throw me your recommendations based on the below conditions?

**Background:**

* Have been gradually hitting more and more Japow in terms of lift-accessed side country (approved freeride zones, pow stashes within resorts, mellow terrain adjacent to/between groomers, resort guides, etc.)...nothing adventurous as I haven't undergone proper avi rescue training
* I will finally get some proper training this season and do BC with guides (so it'll be relatively deep and untracked)
* My current equipment (Rome Factory Rocker + Union Contact Pro) is reaching its limit. Even when setting the bindings set back, my quads are screaming. Plus, it sucks to tank on powder days

**Conditions:**

* Budget: Under $500 USD
* Terrain: Off-piste tree runs, traversing through groomers, not too steep... and *won't tank on a powder day*
* Ollies/pop: Rollers, side hits and natural terrain (no parks though)
* Butters/jib: No, but being able to ride switch for short intervals when I have to would be nice
* Speed/Carving: Don't need speed but would like to carve between hitting powder stashes
* Shape: Nothing too specialized as this will basically be my only board (will keep current board but it's pretty beat up)
* My height: 5'5 / 168 cm... Weight: 150 lb / 68 kg
* Will upgrade bindings to something lot more firm/responsive (i.e. Union Falcor)
* I'm not too picky with the graphics but something without skulls or boobies would be nice

Volume shift but which one,"Hey Shreddit, I'm a little over 6 feet and am about 205 pounds have size 12 boots. I have snowboarded off and on for over twenty years.  I currently have a 19 Capita Mercury 61.

 I'm overwhelmingly a resort rider who enjoys going all over and live in Vermont. I really like to get into the trees when I can, carve when I can't, and hit the park on the way back to the lift.   I love the Mercury even though my feet may be a tad too big at size 12. Despite my love, I want to be able to switch it up sometimes.  I'm looking for a fun volume shift board that will allow me to carve, slash trees, give me some float in case I ever get a powder day, won't boot out, and has enough edge hold for the east.  I know there will be some give and take between those characteristics in the boards.

Here is a list of boards I'm considering.  
Rossignol Sushi, Lib Tech Orca, Ride SuperPig/the Pigs, Korua Dart, Rome Powder Division ST and a handful more.  There are some like Mind Expander or Optimistic that I find interesting, but am afraid they aren't wide enough.  Orca I'm a bit worried that I won't really be able to lay it over with it's width.

"Is this damage (picture below) on a brand new snowboard ""normal"" wear and tear?","Hi,

So I recently bought a GNU Carbon Credit 2020 model along with Bent Metal bindings from retail shop in Cooma, Australia (Rhythm) and had done approximately 3-4 days of riding (probs around half day each time) on groomed bunny slopes, went on chairlifts twice and a few times on the magic carpet. Now I enquired about getting it fixed from the shop I got it from and they said it would take 10-20$ and would need to keep it overnight to glue it together. I'm not concerned about the cost since that's not a huge amount however I'm wondering about the longevity of the board if this chip on the top sheet can happen after such limited usage. I haven't been able to get it fixed yet as I haven't been back to the area recently so yeah thought i'd enquire.

They cleaned out the whole car and returned some cAr chargers and miscellaneous items.

Did i get a too advanced board? (Freeride),"TL;DR: I am not am advanced/pro rider, however a got an advanced board with a huge discount, will this be detrimental to my progression?  

&amp;nbsp;

Hi all, basically after trying different styles i fell in love with freeriding, however i only have a park so i started looking into a new board for this season among the ""last season"" discounts. I had it nailed to Jones Mind expander/Jones explorer/skeleton key/ deep thinker to start with a more ""all mountain"" board and move progressively into freeride.   
However, i couldnt find any of them on my size locally, but while chatting on my local shop, the shop guy told me he had a an Arbor Bryan Iguchi pro camber my size on the basement. I've read reviews for this board but was out of my scope (due to price and level), but this board was used once and changed for a different size, so he offered 65% discount. I checked the board and it was almost brand new, just some tiny ""use"" lines on the base that should go away with wax. So i got it.  
As this is an ""advanced"" board for me, will this be bad for my progression? Should i store/resell it or just stick with it and try to get used to it?",snowboarding,1567066363,Networkingbatman,True,2019-08-29,0

Board/Profile Recommendations for east coast,"I'm a skier who knows how to snowboard, but I'm trying to up my game. My everyday ski setup is the Line Sick Days, which have a rocker/camber/rocker profile and it helps in the trees. On a board I stick to groomers, but want to get good enough this season to hit some woods. I don't hit park at all for either ski or board. Right now, my board is an old Atomic Kung-Pow full camber board (or at least I think it is since I can't find any info on it). 

I've been researching new boards, and I honestly have no idea if I want a CamRock board or a R-C-R-C-R (i.e. Flying V style) board. It seems like the Flying V is more like a rocker profile on a ski - wouldn't that make it harder to get an edge on non-powder hardpack (like in the east)? I see conflicting reviews on it. 

I'm leaning to a CamRock aka R-C-R profile since it seems like I'd be able to get better edge hold.

Boot Recommendation for a narrow/stiff boot,"I'm looking for a stiff boot recommendation for a narrow foot/ankle.  I got to ride the 2020 32 JP Walker Lights (https://www.thirtytwo.com/us/boots/mens/light-jp-boot-8105000358.html?dwvar_8105000358_color=115#start=36) and really liked these for fit, however they are a little soft for me.  

I don't have a preference between boa or regular laces, but my main issue is I get heel lift in most boots.  I currently have the DC Judges and they are way too wide for me.  I also know I don't do well in Burtons.

I know the best thing to do is just go to a boot fitter, but I live in NYC and all we have is Tactics and Zumiesz and I don't think either of those have boots/fitters in the NYC locations (correct me if I'm wrong), so at this point looks like I'll be ordering online.  

I really like the look of the Lashed Premiums (https://www.thirtytwo.com/us/boots/mens/lashed-premium-boot-8105000356.html?dwvar_8105000356_color=200#start=16) and the stiffness sounds right, however they look a fair bit wider and I'm worried about fit.  Anyone tried those or something else that might work well for narrow feet?

Ways to practice snowboarding off-season,"Does anyone have tips for practicing off-season? I'm still learning, but last year I finally started picking up some speed when going.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is whenever I go fast I feel like I'm losing control, and then I usually wipe out. Last year I was starting to feel fairly confident and then I wiped out and fractured a rib.

I don't know how to explain it, but when I go too fast I have a hard time feeling out how to balance my board and where to put my weight on it exactly. I've wiped out a few times flipping forward, so I've been super conscious on trying to put more weight on my back foot when going fast. but doing so I also feel unbalanced and eventually wipe out after a bit.

Is there a way to practice balance off season? I'm somewhat okay with stamina, we usually go from 10am - 3pm or 4pm or so in Whistler, Canada, and I only start getting tired around 2pm, but I usually take a lunch break around then anyway   


The terrain that I have the most trouble with balance is the flat terrains. With really steep terrains I don't even attempt it and just butterfly my way down, but flat ones I have to try to pick up speed or else I'm in for a long ass walk to a steeper area. But I've also wiped out on good terrain with a steady slope (that's where I felt confident and fractured my rib), so any tips are appreciated!",snowboarding,1567221074,devilmonk,True,2019-08-30,0
Whistler Edge Cards,"TLDR: when buying a Whistler Blackcomb Edge Card, do they check ID for the Earlybird deal? (BC residents only)

My brother is visiting from Australia over Christmas and will also be hitting the mountain with us.

Do they check ID or anything with the Edge Card?

Lib Tech/Mervin are amazing!,"Lib Tech Terrain Wrecker 2020 https://imgur.com/gallery/XEIE5iY

Long story short:

Earlier this year I bought a Lib Tech Terrain Wrecker 2019 as I wanted a board that can basically do it all and even after my first time on it, I was just absolutely in love with it. However, after my second ride out I got home and as I was waxing the board on the next day, I noticed a huge crack between the edge and the base. Honestly, I started cursing my life. But after I contacted the shop from which I ordered the board and finally got the time to send it back (2 weeks ago), I got awesome support from both them and Lib Tech. In less than weeks, not only did nobody try to make a big fuss or problem about, but they event sent me the 2020 Terrain Wrecker!

So yeah, just a small appreciation post to praise Lib Tech and to say they definitely won me as a future customer as well! Cant wait to hit the mountain with the new board!

P.S. The shop where I bought the board is called WarehouseOne, so if anyone in Germany is looking for a discount on last years models, give them a look - their customer support rocks as well",snowboarding,1566544827,yordanivanov92,True,2019-08-23,0

From that’s how the Disney character Goofy surfs (in Disney’s 1930’s movie, Hawaiian Vacation) to it’s just ‘goofy,’ in the literal sense, to stand that way because the right foot is controlled by the left hemisphere of the brain which is used for spatial awareness and therefore should be more stabilizing from the back.

Should I give this a go next winter?,"So this last season I really got into skiing for the first time. I had been 3 times in the previous 18 years, but this last season I was able to be on the mountain 16 days, fell in love with it, ended up buying my own gear and all that.

Buddy of mine also got heavily into this season but with a board. He’s also the person I mainly hit the slopes with.

I’m thinking of giving snowboarding a go sometime this next season, but a little hesitant for about 3 reasons:

1 - Opportunity cost: I LOVE skiing and what few precious days I get on the mountain not skiing are lost if I try snowboarding and don’t like it

2 - My understanding is that the first 2-3 days of snowboarding are more frustrating than fun, pain in the butt, pain in the wrists etc

3 - I’d have to rent kit all over again just after I spent all this money on skis and boots

Need advice buying some cheap gear,"  Hello, me and a couple of friends have started taking a few lessons, had a 3 hour session couple of weeks ago, and we're looking into booking some more.

  First impressions were good, it was indoors, so probably nothing like the mountains, but we had loads of fun falling and learning and all that.

  The gear we got for 10 quid as rental though was pretty bad, they only had oversized stuff ( I was given L and XL when I wear S on my streetwear ), because they only had those, also the zipper son most pants were broken, we had do improvise a lot.

  I don't know how often we'll end up going on holidays, but we are planning a big one in france at some festival in march, until then I would like to practice indoors/keep taking lessons.

  So I thought that it might be worth buying some cheap gear. I'm not sure I want to spend too much on this, but I would like to get some trousers,jacket, gloves, I think that's about what I need.

want to get into snowboarding,"Hey r/snowboarding, just recently i have stumbled upon the wonderful world of snowboarding and would love to get a taste. 

Bit of background, im 14 from Australia, i am 164 cm tall and 73-74 kg (i should do some more exercise, got a bit of belly). i have never done snowboarding, skiing or any other board sports. i have spent the last few weeks looking around the internet trying to absorb knowledge and would love some help

some questions:

1. i have looked at lot's of websites and some kinda just seem to be copied and paste sorta thing and dont actually give good advice (just trying to get people to click on their affiliate links), do you's know of any good sources of information, any recommended reading and what kind of things should i know and understand.
2. living in Australia makes it harder to get access to boards and snowy mountains. especially where i live away from the main snowboarding mountains, how could i go about trying snowboarding, to see if i like it? being fourteen means i cant go by myself and i can't really do much (uh) although my school does a skiing and snowboarding trip, in year ten upwards ( so next year for me) and i think that would be a good way, because they get so many people to go we get to use the power of buying in bulk, any other ways.
3. i know i should try snowboarding before i look to buy, but c' mon dont blame me it looks so fun.  i understand that as a beginner im going to spend more time on my ass then on the board, when im learning what kind of board should i get, if i end up liking snowboarding (i think i will, but who knows), what stuff should i look out for, what a good camber profile
4. could anyone simply explain the differences in Ride's pig series, and what would be better for me as a beginner also what's the deal with getting a smaller board then normal and its still works fine if not better, what's the reasoning. i understand that the warping is softer than the super pig and softer boards a typically better for beginners
5. any tips/tricks for picking the right gear, what do look out for, what kind of features
6.  any good gear recommendations, what piece of gear is your favourite and what piece could you not live without
7. the last question i promise, kinda a dummy one, anyone explains why the winter season is, for example, 19-20 is ot different for the southern hemisphere (i understand that winter in Australia is summer in America, right)

thanks so much in advance, cant wait to start learning how to shred.",snowboarding,1566726054,SirGoose1000101,True,2019-08-25,0

"Experienced rider here, just moved to a mountain region and need advice on getting a new board","Hey everyone, I just moved from the midwest to Salt Lake City, and no doubt this calls for a new board! I've been riding for 15 years, most of my experience in park. Current setup is a GNU Park Pickle with K2 Hurrithanes. Super soft and buttery, great for park, and surprisingly good at whipping through trees in powder. However I'm starting to transition into a more freeride style and I'm looking for something more on the aggressive side that will float up in powder, show stability at high speed on groomers, carve deep, and be well maneuverable through trees. I'm 5'10"" 165lb. Strong enough for a heavier or 'rougher' ride but I'd prefer to avoid that.

"Spinning 360s, all in your head?","I've got a bounceboard to practice snowboard tricks on the trampoline during the off season.

Now I'm figuring out that if I keep my eyes up, sort of towards the horizon, I have a lot better balance than if I'm looking at the board or the trampoline. Another thing is trying to figure out when to turn my head, like if I'm doing a FS 360 it helps to look over the left shoulder until I'm about halfway through the spin.

Are there any good YouTube tutorials or blogs that really break it down for me. I'm an old guy so I can't afford to learn how to do spins by falling on my ass a bunch. :P Thanks!",snowboarding,1566787534,lukamu,True,2019-08-25,0

One foot riding technique/risks,"Back in the day (late 90s) when I was young and first started to board, my dad would always insist I was super careful whenever I only had one foot strapped in... 

His mate had tried snowboarding once and when falling whilst getting on a lift, the board spun round and he ended up twisting and injuring his knee quite badly. So because of that I never really learned to ride one footed properly and am still quite wary whenever I've only got one foot in. 

However, nowadays I see more and more clips of people riding one footed, and now the advice is to learn with only one foot in! 

So just wondering, have we been worrying about nothing or has anyone else had/heard of a similar knee injury occurring because the board spun round on them and twisted their knee up?",snowboarding,1566801024,Boocela,True,2019-08-26,0
Can bindings cause foot pain?,"With winter just around the corner, i wanted to ask if bindings can cause foot pain? I ride 2019 union forces with 2019 vans aura pro dual boa’s and noticed that when i was riding i would get your typical foot aches, like needles in the midfoot etc to the point i had to stop and only occured when i was on a certain edge for a prolonged period of time. I also had some aftermarket insoles (Sidas), however those didnt alleviate any of the pain at all. 

Now whenever i wasnt in my bindings my feet would never hurt (i.e walking on the hill etc), but however, my boots did pack out a lil bit and i was getting some toe wiggle/light heel lift when i bent forward and flexed my boot. Could that be the cause and not the bindings? Someone told me before it could be that my boots packed out a tad too big causing me to overcompensate on my bindings making them too tight? i just need to know if anybody has had this problem so i know what to replace for the coming season to have a painless winter.

Board recommendations. Just “upgraded” and I feel off,"I’m 6’1, 170lbs and in my mid twenties. I ride a few times a year and have been trying to get out more.

When I was younger, and probably 5’10(ish) I got my first ever board as a gift.. a Lamar Blazer 151.

Last year, I was reading blogs and found out that my board was to small for my body size.

I went out and bought a K2 Subculture 61. It was a model from a few years back. 

I used it last season and felt all over the place. I just didn’t feel comfortable on the board at all. It seems like I had trouble controlling it and had so much more room on the ends, which I did. Up until that point I was carving and riding a lot more aggressive with my smaller Lamar board.


Any suggestions? I understand I may need time to adjust, but when I first got my Lamar I jumped right on it and picked up quick, riding better than I could now with this K2 board. 

Any other board suggestions or ideas?

I’ve been snowboarding on the same board for 7 years now, a burton dominant 147. Been a great board but definitely time for a new board that fits me a little better. I’m 5’8” 170lbs so i think I’m looking for something in the 153-155 range of size. Would say I’m pretty decent but primarily have been on east coast (went to park city last year which was amazing). I’m looking for a board that is intermediate to advanced, is great for bombing hills but also can be used to dick around in the park, and finally doesn’t break the bank (budget around $400). 

Does anyone have any suggestions?

I’ve been looking at the 2019 lib tech Travis rice pro if anyone has thoughts on that. 

Thanks!",snowboarding,1566228398,kmcnulty20,True,2019-08-19,0
Wondering if I made a mistake on my new setup?,"Hey all, been riding on and off for a while with an older Rossignol board that was a little too short, so decided this was the year to upgrade and get my own setup from scratch. I tend to believe I'm intermediate because I can get down the mountain with full control, no falling, and can play around a bit. By no means am I an expert, but I'm right there in the middle. This summer I bought a Burton Instigator board (2020) with some Mission EST bindings. Want to start out that I've always wanted a Burton since I was younger, so that did play into it (paying for the name) but I also checked reviews and such and though the Roc/Flat/Roc would work for me based on the description and reviews. Now, after of course doing post-purchase research, I may QUICKLY outgrow this board, and of course that's not the best spot to be in when investing in a new setup to hopefully take me for years to come. My style is enjoying the mountain and hitting little kickers or natural stuff down the trail, no real park interest outside of small jibbing, don't enjoy bombing, just really want to enjoy myself.

My questions are:

A.) being im at the point where I'm really ready to start progressing, what profile would best suit me for the next few years? I've bene thinking Roc/Cam/Roc or Cam, but want some better opinions.

B.) im not a huge fan of directional boards, but don't really tend to ride switch, but also don't want the option unavailable as im progressing. What are the thoughts on this? I feel like a directional better suits my style or riding, but im just unsure as I like the twin look and way your supposed to ride it.

C.) if I were to return the board (never ridden, within return window) what are some suggestions on boards that fit the style im talking about. (given your opinion of question A) Budget all in for board/bindings is about $600, im rather partial to the mission binding.",snowboarding,1566232744,Jarmo10,True,2019-08-19,0

Buy advice for a 47yo former ripper,"Haha...  former ripper in like 1990.

I just bought my season pass for 2019/20 at Snowbowl in Flagstaff AZ.  I used to ride a lot back in the day and for the past 10/15 years it’s only been a handful of times here and there.  

I’ve noticed a lot of recommendations are for smaller boards.  I used to ride 152-156 in parks and also deep powder and trees.  I’m 5’7” and about a buck fifty.

I’m not doing the parks anymore but I definitely still strap a helmet on and hit the trees and plan to hit those bluebird powder days.

Wide Boards for Clown Feet (US14),"hey fellas, im 6'1"" 190lbs with the snowboarding curse of large feet. My boots are US 13.5 and ive traditionally rode boards that are ~157. I usually ride at -15/+15 and mostly ride east coast US

I had a 26cm waist width last season (Arbor Westmark) and was still getting some heel and toe drag on deeper days

I want to get into some deeper carving this season but also like to do some smaller park stuff. Im hoping one of you out there has some good suggestions about wider boards. Currently looking at the SuperPig and Party Platter

im worried that my past experience on a 26cm width wont change much with just the bump up to 27/27.5 (especially since i wanna get low like ryan knapton or those nutty eastern europeans)

Lobster Parkboard - Base Waxing and base usage..... Am i doing something wrong?,"Hi there fellow shredders!

So i have just bought a new exactly same board as my old one on summer discount  ;) - Lobster Parkboard (Lobster Eiki Pro Model Hybrid TBT Camber Snowboard).

I am used to the board - like the flex etc...however what i am worried about is if i am not maintaining/waxing my board correctly...?

So... I dont wax the new board until I start feeling the noticeable slow down in speed on the slope... or it becomes too dirty etc...

Wax remover i use: TOKO HC3

Wax: BUTTA ORIGINAL

And when comparing New vs Used bases you can clearly notice the white grease all over the board... does it mean i am doing bad job waxing(i do scrap all the wax with metal file...)? Is it bad wax? or is it dry? or is it natural?

The used board gets white like that even after only one session on the slope after waxing... (the base type is sintered i believe)

Any advice would be verrrrry greatly appreciated !!!

Burton Kilroy vs All Mountain,"Posted in r/snowboardingnoobs, but figured I'd try my luck here as well. Apologies if I broke a rule. 

First time poster with a fairly simple question. I haven't snowboarded in about 10 years, but back then I considered myself an intermediate-advanced level rider, mostly park but definitely rode all over the mountain. 

I've been seriously considering buying a Burton Kilroy, as I loved freestyle riding, even if it wasn't strictly in the park. Does anyone have experience with this board? I'm looking for something with good flex and camber that I can take down pretty much any run (powder notwithstanding, I know its rough in powder). Will this board do the trick down most runs, or should I look at a more ""All Mountain"" board? I've also had my eye on the Ride Agenda, but I just honestly like the look of the Kilroy way more and definitely see myself tackling a park once the rust gets knocked off.

Jones Frontier (new name for Explorer) vs Mountain Twin,"Hey guys

I'm a low-intermediate rider hoping to progress into becoming a solid intermediate rider. I want a board that will do the following:

&amp;#x200B;

(1) Slay groomers. I want to develop my carving to a much higher level. This will be the majority of my riding and I want to get better at this, and is my biggest priority. I'll probably spend 10-20% of my time riding switch.

(2) Riding pow - I want to be able to set back my stance a little and ride side-country/off-piste occasionally (not the major focus for now, but I want the option of doing this). 

(3) Progress to learning some butter tricks like nose rolls and butter 180s etc eventually. Again, not a major focus, but would be nice to learn how to do this stuff to supplement my carving skills.

&amp;#x200B;

I've narrowed it down to the Jones Frontier (the new name for the Explorer, but essentially exactly the same board for 2020) and the Mountain Twin (also essentially the same board for 2020 as before). Good quality boards, magnetraction, mid-stiff flex with the sort of camber profile I'm looking for, sweet graphics etc.  Any thoughts on which one I should go for?",snowboarding,1566341346,karansaraf,True,2019-08-20,0

Advice concerning travelling with gear,"Hi everyone,

So I've travelled overseas a couple times now for boarding. Except now I am planning a trip to Japan for boarding and also just normal travelling, with stop overs in South Korea and Vietnam on my way back to Australia. I don't really want to drag my girlfriend's and my own gear around for the duration of the trip. Anyone ever shipped stuff back home from Japan after they'd finished shredding and went on to travel a bit? I've had a little look around. Lots of options for shipping it within Japan but not so much back to Aus. Obviously the easiest option is just renting gear there but we like our gear and it would defeat the purpose of having our own. Worse case scenario we just lug it everywhere and try to find luggage storage places close to airports. If anyone can share past experiences or advice to do with this logistical pain in the arse it would be greatly appreicated.

Best Snow Resort in the Alps,"Hello everyone, this is my first post here, i hope many are to come.   
We are a team of 4 that love snowboarding. We are from Greece and we are willing to travel to the Alps and stay for a week to snowboard. We are looking for the best overall experience the Alps can offer but we want to avoid extremely pricey resorts.  


First of all we would like to snowboard in December but im not quite sure if the snow will be good at this time around. It is possible for resorts to have good quality snow in that time of the year or should we visit January/February?

We have been snowboarding for 2-7 years so, we are not really into black pistes. We are mostly Freeriders but we enjoy parks, so we would want the resort to have a good park as we dont have those in Greece :(. We also want the resort to have great view. I know Alp mountains have a great view by default but from pictures of resorts it seems that you cant have that magnificent view from everywhere. Lastly, if the village of the resort that we ll stay is nice and has options for the rest of our visit there, that will be a big plus.  


Please share any experience you have if you have visited ski resorts in the Alps. I have done a very brief research and have written down the following resorts. I need to research them more but if you know that some of them are super good/super bad it would be good to know. Sites ranking resorts are not as good as hearing opinions first hand.

Could you give me some guidance/opinions on some of these snowboards I'm currently looking at for my girlfriend's first season out?,"Hello all, noob question inbound. I started boarding last year, grabbed myself the Nitro Prime for like $200 and got to the level where I am confident leafing my way down blackest of double blacks lol. Fast forward to this year, and I want to drag the girlfriend out. Thing is, she isn't much for the research side of things. SO, in my effort to get her good gear for this year, I have been board hunting and narrowed it down to the following boards... (P.S., women's boards suck. There is literally no variety, they all look the same, and non of them use a color darker than red hahaha).     



\*\*HER SPECS\*\*    

5'3, 130lbs, 21 year old female. As coordinated as a potato.     

\*\*Experience\*\*    

Netflix, freshman year of college gen eds, rides a bike once a month, and rented a board for one day last season and took 1.75hrs to go from the lodge to the bottom, and then hit the bar for the remainder of the day. This season, she is spending money so she is obligated to get over the learning curve and pickup this very neat hobby.    

\*\*Goals\*\*    

Make it down the mountain alive. Handle all trails at least skidding down sideways by end of season 1 like I did. Be capable of doing blues and greens without issue, attempting tiny jumps twice a day, maybe.     

\*\*Location\*\*    

Pennsylvania, typically we live at Blue Mountain here. Will take the board wherever we road trip to up north on the east coast. (Would love to see Killington myself this year, but do not see her surviving it)

Atomic Kung Pow Snowboard info?,"I have a second hand kung-pow snowboard I got a few years ago that introduced me to the snowboarding community (top sheet looks like this: https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/atomic-kung-pow-160cm-snowboard-137183977). I really like the board as it's pretty unique, since atomic hasn't really sold boards in the US since the late 2000's. That said, it's showing it's age, and while I have a fresh set of Flow Bindings on them, I think its time for an upgrade soon - but I have no idea where to start looking. Figured I'd start with the profile type that this board was and learn from there. 

I'm a pretty good skier and ride an R/C/R profile (Line Sick Days) when skiing nowadays. My board skills are still pretty intermediate - I don't mind the steeps, but I'm no speed demon and not great on any sort of terrain that isn't a groomer. Think Black Diamonds at Stratton that don't have bumps. However, I'm not opposed to a board I'd grow into as I expect to get the Epic pass this year and send it a bunch more this season than normal.

For reference, I'm about 5'9"", weigh about 170 with a 9.5 boot size.

I went through a number of boards last season starting out with a Burton Custom 158 to a Burton Free Thinker 157 to a Salomon Huck Knife 158. I liked both the Free Thinker and Huck Knife better than the Custom mostly because I was riding more and more switch and the true twin seemed a better fit for that purpose. Also, I'm no expert but the Custom, at times, felt a little unstable when traversing across the mountain -- it was annoying. 

I sold all of these boards at the end of the season and I'm now getting ready to purchase gear for this year. I'm thinking I'll travel with two boards: one directional for powder days and the other my all mountain, freestyle combo board that will be my main ride. 

I've been ready to pull the trigger on a number of boards only to watch or read a review where the reviewer recommends some other board and I feel like I'm just bouncing around. For my all mountain, I was all ready to get a Never Summer Proto Type Two but then read a number of comments about the lack of pop so then I moved on to my current possibility of a Lib Tech T.Rice Pro. For powder, I'd been considering the Lib Tech Orca (recommended by a friend) but then someone else suggested the Jones Mind Expander instead. (And, obviously, there are many, many options.)

Having gone from board to board (to board) while reading reviews, etc., I guess I need to reset my search a bit and get some suggestions from folks.",snowboarding,1565662778,bearmoosewolf,True,2019-08-12,0

Hey guys! Hoping for a board recommendation.,"First of all, sorry to be a pain and making another one of these. I've been spending hours trying to figure it out myself but don't have the experience or knowledge to get the best suited board for me. I'm looking for an all mountain/quiver of one board that I can comfortably ride switch on (though I suck at it).

Stats:
183lbs (83kg)
6'1
11.5 shoe (46eu)

How I ride:

I love my steeps and speed. Also love going through trees on steeps! Can't compromise there. I live on the west coast (crystal mountain is my home resort) and conditions vary. I feel like we haven't ridden a whole lot of fresh powder in the last couple years and probably because I can only ride weekends. It can get chunky and icy. I think I'm an intermediate to advanced rider and don't feel uncomfortable on double blacks. I also ride groomers a fair bit. 

The next thing to consider is jumps. I'm not great at them as but I love hitting them. 

I learned on a giant k2 board cause I was broke. 164 wide.. I think it was traditionally cambered. The last couple of seasons I've been on an old 2006 161/2? Volkl Coal that I picked up from Craigslist. I knew I liked going fast and that's what it's was made for! It's more nimble than the k2 but I don't feel super confident with carving on steeper runs, especially between trees. It's also quite set back, so riding switch is awkward. 


Boards I've been reading about and considering (see I'm not making you guys do all the work.. I've done some research!)


Gnu riders choice:

Looks awesome but it's a rocker hybrid so I worry that this will impact speed performance. Also not crazy about the graphics but it not terrible

Salomon assassin:

This one receives a lot of love, but some complain that it's too soft. 

Yes Standard:

Just started reading about this one

Proto type 2:

Seems like a great all-arounder but it doesn't seem to be any reviewers top choice. 

Niche Story:

Seems legit, but maybe too stiff? (That's what reviewers complain about but it might be great for me?)


Last thing... Is there any way I can get around buying a wide? I somehow made it work with the Coal.. But I also want to not make any stupid decisions.

Does anyone have any good online stores that they use for shopping in Canada? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also any recommendations you have for a Powder Shred Stick? 

&amp;#x200B;

I been looking at a few that tickle my feet 

\- Burton DeepThinker (But not sure if I am a Fan of ETS Binding as it limits the choice of bindings I can use) 

\- Never Summer Swift 

\- Never Summer Big Gun 

\- K2 Simple Pleasure ( I demoed this board last year in some powder and it handles and turns effortlessly) 

&amp;#x200B;

My Style of riding is more aggressive with hard carves and more surf style 

&amp;#x200B;

Does Boot Size come into play when looking for powder boards, I am a US Size 11 so I wonder if I would need a wider board? 

&amp;#x200B;

Any recommendation pointing me in the right direction would be great

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for the Help," 

Hey guys,

Thanks for helping me with my research, more than 45 people took the time out of their day to either respond to the survey or talk to me on the phone. Below is a link to a spreadsheet with the responses. 40% of respondents experience knee pain while skiing/snowboarding, however the sample consists of mostly &lt;30 year old athletes. In a separate survey which I also shared below, 57% of respondents experience knee pain while skiing/snowboarding and 10 use knee braces. This sample consisted of mostly family friends &gt;50 years old.

I have convinced my entrepreneurial advisers at the SDSU ZIP Launchpad that this is a problem worth solving (skiing is the ideal early adopter market, in a perfect world this could be applied to arthritis patients). Now I need to find an medical device adviser to partner with me and provide insight into the healthcare industry.

Thanks again for the support. Take a look at some of these websites for similar brace concepts which I hope to improve upon.

"Finally got NS Proto Type Two, but seller lied and sold me 157 instead of 154 -- keep or return?","So after graduating college, getting a ""real"" job and having a little flexible spending, I finally got myself a properly sized snowboard...or so I thought. 

I've wanted the Proto 2 for awhile and finally had the cash to get one. So I bought a deck on eBay that was supposed to be a 154, but the seller lied to me and actually sent the 157 (it's a long story). Anyway, I paid $430 for it, brand new. 

Now I have this deck but I don't know whether I should just hold on to it and get over the 3cm difference, or try to jump through all the hoops to return it, get my money back and order a 154 for significantly more cash (MSRP is $590). 

But do you think I should keep it and I'll enjoy it, or I really should try to get the right size deck? I'm 5'11 and 145lbs (pretty lean). I'm an intermediate rider looking to get better in the park but really use as an all mountain board.",snowboarding,1565358595,Chesterington,True,2019-08-09,0

Is used gear worth it?,"Basically title. Recently got divorced (woo cheating wife :/). Figure since I can focus on myself now, I want to start snowboarding more. I'm still getting life stuff situated, but I would like to get a snowboard/boots/bindings. I probably will go riding a few times a  year, nothing too crazy. Ideally I would be okay with some gently used gear, especially since that would save me some money (hey fun fact, divorces are expensive) while I get my life squared away.  

  

Is it worth it to buy used? Where would I start? Forgive my ignorance on the matter. Any brands you guys/gals recommend for boots/bindings/board? I'll have to look up what I want in a snowboard because I honestly don't know. All I know is I am not very skilled (I've been seven times between NC, NM, and CO), so probably something on the entry- or moderate-level. I recall riding in Crested Butte and they were doing a demo day (buddy worked in the rental shop at the time, so he managed to get me on some prototype boards). All I was able to gather was I don't think I can handle a super firm (stiff?) board, because I'm not that good at turning/carving quickly, and I am not a speed demon downhill yet.

"Looking for a snowboard, need advice","I have typically rented for the past 3 years instead of buying my own, now that I have a better job I can afford to pay for a nice snowboard without hurting.

**So the main question is, do I go for all-mountain boards because of potential iciness or do I go with the freestyle board for the extra bend/flex and easier tricks?**

Typically when riding, I prefer the terrain park and simple hills rather than black diamond or difficult terrain. I like to do jumps, tricks and all that. So I was thinking a freestyle board, however, my mountain can suffer from really icy conditions very often. I read that all-mountain boards handle icy conditions much better than freestyle. But one of my favorite features of all the snowboards I've used is the flex. Most of the boards I rented were a little stiff, but I got this really nice board to rent once (they kind of just grab you any board in your size so it's like a lottery) it was a little smaller, but I could do wheelies (pull the nose up) really easily and it was super easy to do spins and tricks. I really enjoyed this board.

**If freestyle or all-mountain, what is a good board to choose that isn't super expensive, I don't want to break the bank.**",snowboarding,1565373074,zachcipp,True,2019-08-09,0

SkiBuds- chat app for finding friends so you don't have to ski or snowboard on your own,"I am happy to share that I have released an app to help skiers and snowboarders find other people to ride with based on their skill level for IOS and Android.  This app will help you find other riders who want to shred anything from greens to backcountry and uses geolocation so that for most channels in the app (actual ski channels) you must be within 50km (current distance, which will most likely change based on input).  The idea behind this is that the travel and general channels are open to everyone (so people can find others to travel with) and people posting messages and images in the ski channels are currently at or will be at the mountain.  Currently if you are within 50km you will be able to check in at the mountain.  If you are checked in other users will be able to see this by seeing a green circle over your profile picture.  This check in will automatically check you out after 12 hours to make sure people see who is really actively using the app and find riders for that given day.

I am still working on figuring out the best roll out strategy and ideally want to have this app at all mountains, but as of now the plan is to move to Colorado and spread the word of Skibuds across the rockies before moving on to other areas, so the mountains currently on the app will not be consistent with November release.

I appreciate all suggestions as to new features to add or how to revamp others.  This app was built based on the input of many people I met last year on the chairlifts and in the village of Whistler, and the community is what can really help drive this to be a useful app which can make chasing storms on your own much more fun.  The app is built with React Native and Firebase.  I am also looking for people to help promote the app or others looking to work with me to help grow the app.

Happy Shredding!

Pressure on the legs when trying boots,"Hi, I need some help regarding boots.

Yesterday I went to a snowboard shop to buy boots for thew first time.  
I tried 3 different mid range BOA boots and they were all pretty good except, when I leaned forward (like toe edge...) I felt pressure in a specific point in the bone in both legs. This pressure came from the liner as I saw there was still some room between the liner and the tongue. I thought maybe it was because of the BOA but the same thing happened when I tried regular laces.

I don't recall having this problem When I first snowboarded back in February, but maybe it was because I had some cheap rental boots or I didn't tighten them enough.

I know I could get away with looking 22 because I'm only 24 and look young. My question is, could I actually get away with it? Is there any age verification afterwards? I know, I'm cheap and I suck but it's hard justifying giving an extra couple hundred dollars to the people I think that are ruining the sport.

Who Is The Thrasher of Snowboarding?,"Yo everybody. I or well we just recently started actually snowboarding after our tour bus stopped in Cali and we hit Mt. Mammoth and I gotta say the shit was wild. So I’ve been paying close attention to this sub trying to learn more about the culture everyday. I’m not exactly *brand* new to snowboarding culture but in the hood, shit Chicago in general, it’s just not something someone wakes up and say let’s do or watch outside of maybe when the Olympics on, or I guess video games like steep and ssx.

Anyway, I’ve been looking into brands and shit and was wondering who was the thrasher of snowboarding? When I was a shorty snowboarding was pretty much just as wild as skateboarding was but fast forward to today it’s more “professional” I should say. 

Also board recommendations would be nice too, we were gifted with two from Burton but I want to buy my own to feel more connected to it and invested in the sport. I want to know who has the best graphics and won’t snap after a month or so.

Snowboard boots advice requested - sore feet vs heel lift,"Hi,

As I have pretty wide toes and narrow heel I have a serious problem with fitting almost any shoes other than sneakers. The problem is much more perceptible in my right foot. Winter boots, suit shoes, snowboard boots, birkenstocks - you name it. I used to buy larger shoes as lower sizes caused the tension in the toebox. These shoes later tended to break in and become too big, as they started to be in the right width after breaking in, and then it turned out that they are just too long. 

I recently switched to Burtons US10 from US11 I have Burton Photon Boas and this pair gave me perfect feeling of the deck and no heel lift. The problem is that after \~1h of wearing them they hurt my feet in the toes area so much that I REALLY can't bear it. This forced me to occasionally take them off on the slope to make it anyhow bearable. I tried riding absolutely loose in the toes area (I mean lacing)but that didn't help. 

Eventually I went to the snowboard shop and asked guys there to heat my inner shoe up to mold it. It actually helped - now I can comfortably wear these boots whole day BUT I have a terrible heal lift in them right now! Even lacing them super-thightly doesn't help.

What can I do? Have I destroyed my shoes? How can I fit my shoes to have both - no pain and no heel lift? Maybe I should get softer boots in the correct size?

Looking forward for your advice.",snowboarding,1565034397,Inside_Perception,True,2019-08-05,0

Yes PYL vs Neversummer Proto,"Hi folks, got another offseason board recommendation question:

To keep it simple I am looking for a replacement for my [2008 Gnu CHB](https://www.evo.com/outlet/snowboards/gnu-carbon-high-beam-mtx-snowboard-2007)

I am an low end intermediate rider and I pretty much just enjoy freeride although I’ll hit a small jump or two in the park, but love to pop off natural features. 

I really like the Yes Pick your line [Yes PYL](https://thegoodride.com/snowboard-reviews/yes-pick-your-line-2012-2019-snowboard-review/)

And 

The Neversummer prototype 2 [NS proto](https://thegoodride.com/snowboard-reviews/never-summer-proto-type-two-2016-2019-snowboard-review/)

The yes PYL is more freeride oriented which I like but perhaps a little less playful / unforgiving (although the goodride review says it’s easy enough to ride for intermediates). I also like that I can take this in powder if the time comes.

I demoed the NS Proto last year and really liked it. It was fun and playful, but 1) I don’t do freestyle riding except for hitting small natural kickers 2) I don’t ride switch (i.e., can’t ride switch)  3) powder is this boards main weakness.

I am leaning more toward the yes PYL but am worried that as a low end intermediate rider I might not have as good a time as on the NS Proto. But I feel it suits my riding style better and would work in powder as well.

Seeking guests for podcast about life after being a competitive athlete,"Hey r/snowboarding

I'm producing a podcast about the transition from being a competitive athlete to everything after. The podcast, called ""Run Along"", was created with the hope of opening up the depth and breadth of this conversation. We’re going from the surface-level topics -- e.g. what to do with all your random participation trophies and how to not be the aggressive slide tackler in the over 30 league -- to the bottom of the ocean convos -- think loss of identity and a skewed sense of self-worth. The hope is to also gather as many kinds of stories as possible. Olympians, high school ballers, super-fan parents, and athletes who dealt with injury, congenital defects and everything in between.

Sooo, I was wondering if any former competitive snowboarders here would be interested in coming on the pod? Would also love to hear what people are doing as real life adults with careers and maybe how being a competitive snowboarder imbued with you traits/attitudes that have helped you succeed now -- whether that be as employees, partners, etc!

Using freestyle bindings for carving.,"I noticed a good deal on some now IPO bindings, so I brought them without doing as much research as I should have. When they arrived, I noticed a piece of paper that suggests they are geared toward freestyle boarding.

Intermediate rider looking for my first board - Lib Tech vs. Never Summer vs. Yes,"I'm picking out a board for next season after renting for two seasons. I'm an intermediate rider who rides resorts - **groomers and some powder**. **No park**, rails, jumps, buttering, jibbing or anything like that. I just want to ride down the run smoothly and accurately - that's what I enjoy. **The bane of my existence is ice** \- need to get better at riding the ice this season.

I'm mostly looking for a board that will boost my confidence by giving a **stable ride, good edge hold** (but not at the expense of forgiveness), and **relatively easy turn initiation**. Nothing too fancy.

Two things I'm not sure on - should I go **hybrid rocker or hybrid camber?** **I don't love going fast**. The bigger priority for me is stability and being able to turn with relative ease. I'm not a huge carver but I'd like to improve that skill this season.

Also, not sure on what flex to get. Seems like medium to medium stiff is the way to go, but I don't have much of an opinion here.

Budget is not a big concern but would like to keep it under \~$550.

**Right now I've picked out a few boards I think are potentially a good fit. Two hybrid rockers and one hybrid camber:**

* Lib Tech Terrain Wrecker ( [https://thegoodride.com/snowboard-reviews/lib-tech-terrain-wrecker-2018-2019-snowbard-review/](https://thegoodride.com/snowboard-reviews/lib-tech-terrain-wrecker-2018-2019-snowbard-review/) ) - good reviews all around; magnetraction would provide good edge hold; potential downside would be the looser feel due to its hybrid rocker profile
* Never Summer West ( [https://thegoodride.com/snowboard-reviews/never-summer-west-2016-2019-snowboard-review/](https://thegoodride.com/snowboard-reviews/never-summer-west-2016-2019-snowboard-review/) ) - seems very similar to the Terrain Wrecker (hybrid rocker profile), but subjective reviews suggest it may have a slightly more stable / camber feel
* Yes Typo ( [https://thegoodride.com/snowboard-reviews/yes-typo-2016-2019-snowboard-review/](https://thegoodride.com/snowboard-reviews/yes-typo-2016-2019-snowboard-review/) ) - hybrid camber board that seems more suited to groomer riding; hard to deny that camber gives better grip/stability than a rocker; underbite technology helps with grip; supposedly a little stiffer than the above two boards

WA Snowboarders: Which Mountain?,"So, I just moved east of the Cascades and it's time to decide on a season pass. My options are Snoqualmie, Stevens, Mission Ridge, Crystal and White Pass. I've decided to nix Sno/Stevens due to the crowds, and Crystal due to distance, so that leaves MR and WP. People that have ridden both, which would you chose? They're both about the same distance, and crowds/traffic don't seem to be an issue even on the weekends. From my research, WP seems to have better, more consistent snow, but very little advanced and zero ""extreme"" terrain, and a typical ""family"" mountain type park. MR looks like it has a cool little rope tow park, heavier terrain, and blower, CO style pow on the rare occasions there IS pow. Other wise, I understand it's crusty and windy.

&amp;#x200B;

 While I'm okay with the latter, and having poor contrast sensitivity (flat light caused a serious injury 3 years ago, this will be my first season since) the high quantity of sunny days is appealing, this will be my first season in WA and I'd like to get in on some of that heavy snowfall I've heard so much about. I figure I can always take time off and head to stevens/baker/alpental mid week if I feel like getting sendy. So, what do you think? Are my impressions of those two mountains accurate, and is there any reason I should choose MR over WP? Thanks!",snowboarding,1563901014,BataleonRider,True,2019-07-23,0

Struggling to find a comfortable stance set up,"Hi, wondering if I could grab some advice on stance set up. I’ve (finally) got my own board but im struggling to work out a comfortable position, have a bit of an issue (mildly embarrassing), I kind of have duck feet that stick out, quite a bit, and for my knees to bend straight, they need to stick out quite a bit, my current set up is causing my knees to bend inwards but twisting them out or widening the stance doesn’t seem to help....

my friend who’s an instructor set it up for me and the way she did it was ok but the right side of my foot painfully pushed against the binding. I haven’t been in around 7 months due to a bad ankle injury but (with her help as I didn’t know how to do it) decided to try and twist it out more, still didn’t feel right so she made it wider which was even more uncomfortable and then she had to go and teach so another guy did it and the poor lad was faffing about so much I felt bad and just accepted it after a number of tries. I also stood on my friends board which is a bit smaller than mine and she has the bindings quite narrow and that was painful. 
I’ve now got really sore knees after riding for a couple of hours and my right knee is painful to bend, granted I went down on them a couple of times but even just being stood on the board made me knees feel twisted and painful. 

Basically, in short, any advice on how to set up stance for someone with duck feet because my knees are killing and it just feels uncomfortable and contorted, please help!

"Newb Question about ""Advanced/Expert"" Snowboards","My quesiton is twofold, so I'll try to make it brief for you all, I really appreciate any insights you can provide!

**Quick Context**: I've snowboarded for about 10 years now, but it's been about 3 years since i've been out. Getting back into it this season with a few trips planned (Keyston Colorado and Stowe Vermont). *I'm not that good*. I don't do park/tricks or steep hill bombs or anything. I really just like cruising/carving down the blues.

**Current stats**: My current board is a 152cm Rome Agent, rusted edges, 10+ years old. I've also outgrown it (I'm now 6'1"", 180lbs). Because of this, I'm on the market for a new board. I would prefer an All-Mountain board.

**First Question**: I've really come to like the look/appeal of the Burton Skeleton Key. I've also read a lot of positive reviews. The thing is, it's marked as an ""Advanced/Expert"" snowboard. What does this mean? I consider myself ""Intermediate"", will I struggle with this board?

**Second Question**: The two options I have are 158cm and 162cm. My understanding is that you sacrifice control for speed when it comes to sizing up on a board. Since this is an ""expert"" board, would it be a little more forgiving if I go with the 158cm?

Should I get CASI qualification now (midway through uni) or find a training+employment package after I graduate? and other instructor related questions! [Located in Ontario],"Hello everyone! This is more of a life-situation question than a snowboarding technique question, but I was hoping anyone with CASI/instructor experience could advise me!
 
I’m 19, midway through a chemistry degree, and I’m hoping to go be a snowboard instructor for a few years once I finish my degree. 
 
I’m currently located in Ontario, but was wondering if it’s worth the price to get my CASI Level 1 and 2 now at a local hill, as opposed to finding a training+employment package after I graduate. 

- I’m not sure if employers will prefer someone who already has level 1 qualifications from a few years ago, or someone who has no qualifications. I’m also thinking that it might be cheaper to do training+employment package since the CASI cost will presumably be less...

I’ve also seen mentions about instructor positions being understaffed in general/visa restrictions in Canada causing resorts in Alberta/Banff region to want more instructors, but they were from four years ago, is it still true now?

If it matters, I’m hoping my language skills (can speak English, Mandarin, and Cantonese) will help my employment prospects, especially at resorts with many Asian tourists. I can also ski, but I'm not really planning to get qualified for it.

Thank you everyone in advance!",snowboarding,1564076760,stickyricedragon,True,2019-07-25,0

Should I upgrade my ex-rental Burton Progression Custom Bindings,"Hey yall,

&amp;#x200B;

I bought an ex-rental kit in 2015 comprising:

\- Burton Easy Livin 2016 155  
\- Burton Progression Boots and;  
\- Progression Custom Bindings.

&amp;#x200B;

Ive done a number of trips each year since then and have gotten good bang for my $400 AUD.

&amp;#x200B;

The stitching on the boots is coming apart although they're not leaking yet so i can probably get away with these.

&amp;#x200B;

**The bindings however** are starting to look a little tired, the toe strap is starting to fray (cosmetic issue) and the ratchets are starting to not bite anymore, as in i could get them to ratchet down much more tightly when i bought them and now only the first few teeth will bite.

&amp;#x200B;

Im thinking of grabbing some Burton Cartel 2018's for $300AUD, is it really worth it going for better quality bindings or should i save $100 and get some Customs or save $50 and get Missions?

Buying gear to sell for profit?,"I was watching a vid by the angrysnowboarder where he was talking about the Lib Tech Orca and how it's amazing and sells out, before being sold for up to double the price on ebay/online later on in the season. So if anyone wanted to make some money, they should buy a bunch early season and then sell them for profit later in the season.

 I have also heard through a friend of someone who bought a few Burton Step On boots and bindings last season, knowing that they generally tend to sell out within weeks/month or so after being released, in order to sell them for big profit later on. The same guy also buys gear at 40-60% discount at the end of season/post-season only to sell it for just below retail price when the next season begins, making quite a bit of money.

 What do people think of this in terms of feasibility or risk of not being able to sell stuff at profit?

Board/Binding question! Any advice helps.,"I've been snowboarding for about 3-4 years averaging 5-6 times a year.

My favorite thing is to go in trees and hit powder. Jumps are something I'll do but not my main goal.But mostly looking for something that doesn't sink in the powder. I'm not trying to catch major air or anything. 

I'm not sure where to look for info, but the city I live in has a big expo coming up for snowboarding gear. I'm not wanting to walk in blindly and get either a shitty brand or something that doesn't fit my riding style. Ive heard the general rule of thumb is having the board be near your chin in length.

I've never tried a box or rail you have to jump on to. This past season I tried 50-50s on a tube for the first time. OVerall I just suuuuuck at boxes/rails.

Burton Cartel slipping/locking issues,"I've been having some issues this season with my cartels when there has been soft snow on top of the trail getting into the binding mechanism.

&amp;#x200B;

If I'm riding all day then towards the afternoon one of the toe straps will just constantly slip off. It won't click at all when closing and comes the whole way off when I'm riding. Thankfully I can ride at about 90% without the toe strap but it's not ideal. I don't have any solution to this, I've tried giving the bindings a good shake and trying to brush out any snow but it never really works.

&amp;#x200B;

On occassion the straps have also completely locked up, to the point where I had to use a ski strap to lift and apply enough pressure to undo them - I physically could not get them off with my bare hands. This is more of a problem on my front foot as I don't undo the strap as often. I've found that if I loosen/tighten the strap whenever I'm waiting in the lift queue then the problem isn't so bad.

Splitboarding Tips and Info for a Newbie...???,"I have never splitboarded before and I want to start trying it next year. Since splitboarding seems pretty hard from a logistical view point when it comes to finding the right/easiest mountain for splitboarding...

A. Are most newbies to splitboarding just going with ski resorts/trails/mountains/spots that are already popular or are known for splitboarding by more experienced splitboarders...? 

Because no one in there right mind is willing to try and hike some mountain in the middle of nowhere in order to snowboard when the probability of finding the right mountain/conditions/trails is so low. Its like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Therefore...

B. Are most splitboarding trails/spots/mountains/ski resorts only a 'In The Know', 'Word of Mouth' or 'Locals Only' kind of thing. 

Some basic questions...

1. In general...How long of a hike or distance is an average snowboarder trying to hike in order to have the 'longest run' possible...? 1/4 mile...? 1/2 mile...? 3/4 mile...? 
2. In general...How many feet of vertical or elevation gain is an average snowboarder trying to hike in order to get steep enough for some decent speed/fun...? Obviously...its not worth it to go splitboarding if the run is very flat or has no pitch/steepness to it at all, even if its possibly a long run. 
3. In general...How many runs are most people trying to achieve in a day of splitboarding...? I figured most people can only muster the energy for 1 run since the hiking part takes so long and is very hard and strenuous right...? Or can/do some people muster the stamina/energy to hike a second or even third time/run depending on length of day, length of hike and/or vertical elevation gain...? 
4. In general...How do you 'plan' your run so that you can end up back at the car, road or at the same spot where you started your hike...? Obviously...that would be a nightmare if you ended up veering to far away and getting lost and than not being able to find your way back to the car or where you started the hike at. Is there some kind of app or gps device that is made to help snowboarders from getting lost and being able to find their way back to their base/car with ease...?
5. In regards to number 5...Do most splitboard trips require a fair bit of planning with maps and google earth and what not so the possibility of getting lost is very low...? 
6. Can a ski resort fine you or kick you off the mountain if they find you splitboarding in bounds of the resort with no lift ticket...? Do most ski resorts have policies/rules against splitboarding since they know some people will try and hike and snowboard inside resort boundaries in order to avoid buying a lift ticket and would now technically be labeled as 'trespassing'...?

Bindings Won't Mount to Board,"Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

Recently purchased a YES Typo 156W and I am almost certain it was a demo. The base, edges and topsheet are in great shape but it seems that the inserts are super bored out. New union flite pro bindings won't mount with the hardware to the board. If I remove the baseplate from the binding, the nut and washer stick out from the baseplate enough to grab the inserts so I know they aren't stripped. When I put the baseplate back into the binding, set it to -15 or +15 respectively, the nut doesn't grab the insert for some reason. Wondering if anyone else has dealt with this or if I should get a refund on the board. All mounting hardware is the same length, its just super strange, never dealt with this before and have put together plenty of thrashed setups.

North America: affordable places to stay near mountain for a group of 6 or 7.,"OK, this is super early, I know, but I want this trip to go as well as possible, and I gotta start narrowing down my options a little bit. I'd love your input, so please bear with me.

I'm organizing a ski/snowboarding trip for a group of friends (mostly beginners, all in our early 30s, they'd be taking at least 1 day of lessons) next year (Jan. 30 - Feb. 3, 2020). We only have a few days off for this trip, and don't want to drive more than 1 - 1.5 hour from the city where we land to the resort. We'd also prefer to minimize the use of the rental car, so finding not-crazy-expensive accommodation near the resorts would be the best, where we could walk or take a short public transportation ride to go to the lifts.

Based on dates, resorts' proximity to airports and flight costs I've narrowed it down to 4 different areas, although I haven't picked specific resorts yet. I'm open to suggestions based on our accommodation preferences: Lake Tahoe, flying into Reno; Rocky Mountains near Denver; Banff (think Norquay and Sunshine Village, more than Lake Louise) and the Laurentides near Montreal.

From these areas, I've snowboarded in the Laurentides, Colorado (Vail only, but that's too far for this particular trip) and have been a couple of times to Banff, but only in the summer. For Montreal I was thinking Tremblant, although I don't love that it's packed (same issue for Banff, actually) or Saint Sauveur, but I always did Sauveur as a day trip from Montreal, so I don't know if there's anything to do in the village besides snowboarding? I considered staying in Montreal if we end up going to Saint Sauveur, but 1 hour each way for three days, plus snow and traffic, seems annoying to me, so I'd rather just stay in the village, if it's worth the visit.

I'd love to pick your brain on ideas and experiences regarding what resort(s) to choose and possible places to stay. Could be hotels, vacation rentals, or even hostels. If I forgot to include any information, let me know.

Thanks everyone!",snowboarding,1562627029,jclinares,True,2019-07-08,0
Qanatas board bag,"Hi all, 

TL;DR my board bag exceeds Qantas baggage dimensions

I'm flying to NZ for a snow trip and plan to bring me and my girlfriend's boards in a board bag. I have a connecting flight on Air New Zealand from Auckland to Queenstown where their website says sporting equipment dimensions and weight can be up to 2m and 23kg. Which my bag is under for both, yay!

However, Qantas' website is very limited on its information on sporting baggage. https://www.qantas.com/au/en/travel-info/baggage/sporting-equipment.html#snow-ski-or-snowboard

From what I can gather, skis and boards can be checked in so long as they comply to the checked baggage allowance restrictions, being under 30kg and that the sum of the bag's width height and depth not exceed 158cms.

I contacted Qantas using the live chat function, where they basically said the same thing on the website and that I should contact Qantas freight. 

Seems a bit silly that they expect snow equipment to fit that dimension criteria, I mean my board alone is 154 cms. Moreover, their dimension restrictions for bikes (140x30x80cms), surfboards (277cms in length), golf clubs (exempt from dimension restrictions) etc. Are all a lot more lenient that that of snow equipment. 

Has anyone recently travelled internationally on Qantas with skis/boards and had any issues?

Gear advice/Help: Newbie looking for a new board to add this next season.,"Heyo, so let me tell you the deal here and fill you in. I'm looking for another board to add this season but as a newbie the amount of reviews and information is borderline overwhelming. So I spent over 40 days last season learning things, it had been about 10 years since I had been on a mountain before that so I considered it my true first season bc those were short trips. (Just a couple days a few times) I rode a 161 Burton Wide Clash with Flo bindings and had a blast at Winterpark and A-basin all season. So now I'm looking upgrade/add a new board....but daaaaaam...there is so much going on with boards. With the price being what they tend to be I dont really wanna just blindly pick so I've been trying to research but like I said it's a bit overwhelming....I'm a newbie dammit. That's what brings me here, to you guys, the experts. I'm not too interested in the park, I have a surfy style and like to ""carve"" the best I can. Natural features, the occasional small jump in the park but for the most time I wanna lay out my turns and haul ass.

Hawaii/Mauna Kea Snowboarding...???,"Has anyone here tried snowboarding in Hawaii on the Mt/Volcano Mauna Kea...? 

Sounds stupid and I seriously thought it was not possible ever since I started snowboarding. But I got curious about it last week and I googled it and to my surprise...I found out that you can actually snowboard in Hawaii...!!!

I know what most people are thinking...'if you live in the mainland US and have a relatively easy access to a local ski resort...why even bother going to Hawaii for snowboarding even if you can snowboard there...'

The thing is...I have a lot of friends that live in Hawaii but I have never visited Hawaii before in my life. I am trying to plan a trip to Hawaii in the next year or two to see friends and I figured why not try and 'kill 2 birds with 1 stone' and try to snowboard for a day on Mauna Kea as well just for 'grins and giggles'.

If there just happens to be someone in here who has snowboarded Mauna Kea before or has tried or knows some info/tips...

What month would be the best time to go...? I figured since Hawaii is located in the latitudes of the tropics and no where near the northern hemisphere...The best time for snowboarding Mauna Kea might be a 'crap shoot' and you might be forced to just try any month to see how it goes.",snowboarding,1562791252,Tiger_Bite_Kid,True,2019-07-10,0

Patagonia Shell Jacket Choices,"Backstory:  I moved to the mountains almost two years ago and bought a Patagonia  Descentionist pant and a Mountain Hardware shell. I was on the mountain  120 days in the two seasons and ravaged both pieces. I took the pants  into my local Patagonia shop sporting giant gouges/tears from trees  (repaired with tenacious tape), zipper issues, and some delam. They took  them in, decided they couldn't repair it, and gave me full value credit  (and i bought them on sale for half off at $160 to begin with). Blown  away by this service and after reading more about the company I'm a  convert to their ethos.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm  5'9"" 155lbs with an athletic build (wide shoulders/chest and small  waist 31""). Now the problem is that ArcTeryx really do fit the best of  any outerwear I've tried, but my experience with their warranty is  subpar. My favorite piece of clothing EVER, the ArcTeryx Atom LT jacket,  got a little tear in the sleeve and they wouldn't do anything in  regards to their ""lifetime warranty"" so they are out for me. If you  wanted to know, they told me it's made to be a midlayer and not an outer  layer so a snag from a bush isn't their problem.

&amp;#x200B;

So  back to Patagonia. I took my $380 ""refund"" and bought an excellent  condition size 31"" PowSlayer pant from Patagonia Worn Wear for 1/3 their  MSRP and have about $150 still to spend with them. The pants are a  little long (I'm a 30"" inseam), but with the boots they will be fine.  Now I'm looking at upgrading my beat up Mountain Hardware shell jacket. I  haven't been able to find many of the Patagonia shells to try on as it  is summer here, but want to snag one when it pops up on Worn Wear (or  craigslist).

&amp;#x200B;

My  question is if anyone has experience with the fit of all the Patagonia  shells? I was able to try on a small and it was just a tad too tight in  the chest/shoulders, but couldn't find a medium to try on. How does the  Powder Bowl (or any of the others you've tried) fit in comparison to the  PowSlayer jacket?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance for any advice!

Burton Yeasayer Flying V vs Flat Top - which is better for a beginner?,"Hello everyone! I am midst buying my first snowboard. I've only been looking at Burton snowboards as I am inheriting some hand me down bindings and boots that are of Burton brand.

&amp;#x200B;

After some reseach - I have initially concluded that the Yeasayer Flying V was probably the most ideal board profile, because it's a hybrid, twin board, and supposedly least likely to catch an edge. I also read that traditional cambers and flat tops are not really recommended for beginners are they're more likely to catch an edge.

&amp;#x200B;

However, when I went to our local store to inquire if they were going to stock the flying V version, I was told that they were only stocking the flat top version, because they've **tested both boards and felt that the flat top does a good job being catch free** but offers a bit more of a constant carving experience for a board of that stiffness.

&amp;#x200B;

Was wondering if any  one has any recommendations/suggestions/experience to share as a beginner whose gone with a flat top board (or the exact same models of snowboard), or could advise which version of the board is better for a beginner?

&amp;#x200B;

Additional info (if it helps):

1. I've only snowboarded ONCE before this in Japan, I used a Burton LTR rental snowboard at the time and that board was OK.
2. I will be going to Melb in August where I'm seeing from their (resort's) instagram page the snow is less fluffy and a bit more icy.
3. Will be going to Japan again next year for more fluffy snow.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was hoping to get a board that might be OK for both the fluffy and more compact snow conditions! Would appreciate any advice / insight heaps! Thanks in advance :)",snowboarding,1562206802,moomoomew,True,2019-07-03,0

Snowboard Website to Watch Edits,"So this question gets brought up every few months here and I don't think there is a real answer, but where can I go to watch snowboard edits?

* YouTube and Instagram are fine if you know a specific crew or channel to search for or follow, but then I never know how to find new people/places
* This subreddit is probably the only place I can easily find edits of people I never would have heard of, but it's also just so bogged down with other random-ass posts (which is fine, that's what it's for)
* Yobeat was good, but it did just become thinly-veiled advertisements before it went under

Upgrade from Clash to Proto Type 2?,"I like to think I’m an intermediate but my skills are pretty uneven.

I’ve done two seasons with two trips each with the clash and I find:

I enjoy carving but I think it’s probably a bad idea to go for a dedicated carving board as I’m not an advanced rider.

The clash is a flat board but I still find I catch an edge too often, wondering if getting a camber type board is the right choice.

I’m based in the UK so do a lot of boarding in our indoor ski slopes which are very confined and require tight turns. The clash I think is a good fit (or I’ve just done it so much I’m used to it) and wonder if spending money on the proto is a bit of a waste.

Last question (unrelated): I get a lot of foot pain and have realised it’s because my boots are too soft and I can’t do enough of the work with my knees.

Big feet and bindings help - changing from Burton 14US to different brand 13?,"I have some Burton Ruler Speedzone boots size 14 US / 13 UK.

&amp;#x200B;

I actually normally wear 13US/12UK in shoes, and the other brand boots I tried in the shop (ThirtyTwo, Adidas) were true to fit, and 13US was fine, but with Burton I had to size up to 14US (even though the Mondo sizes don't seem to be different). I preferred the Burton's in style/look and so went with those.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently bought a Nidecker board (wide) and some large size Union Force bindings. I'm finding doing up the bindings can be a bit difficult/more time consuming than I would like (even with everything adjusted on the bindings to the maximum - heel cup, ankle and toe strap). It fits, and I can still board but the straps are not completely centred and it takes a little longer to do my back foot up in the bindings than I would like, though it's not a dealbreaker.

&amp;#x200B;

The question I want to ask is this:

&amp;#x200B;

If I were to buy a boot from a different brand (eg. 32 or Salomon) in size 13 US/12 UK which will still fit me fine, do you think it would be a bit easier to do up the bindings? I imagine there might be less external diameter of those boots compared with the Burton that might make them (admittedly very slightly) smaller in their external dimensions and make the staps a bit more centred/easier to do?

Need a new board for teaching in Japan,"I'm currently riding a Lic Tech T Rice Pro - its a great board, super responsive, solild edge hold, and playful enough to take in the park and butter about on. Its a really good board to teach clients on. But it's the blunt nose 155cm, and it doesn't have the best float in powder. And I'm going to bloody Japan next season. So I think it's about time I searched for an upgrade.

So I'm looking for something along the lines of an all mountain/freeride board. Something directional that still rides well switch, floats in pow, and has the playfulness to take into the park, but aggressive enough to really hold an edge. I'm thinking something along the lines of the Capita Kazu Pro or the Arbor Bryan Iguchi Pro Camber. The GNU Mullair was another one I looked at but I prefer traditional camber as opposed to rocker dominant profiles.

What TYPE of snowboard is right for me (profile)?,"Hello! First time poster in this sub :) 

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been snowboarding for a while now and I'm looking to buy my first snowboard as for almost the last decade, I've just been hiring boards on the mountain and want to get a tad serious. I don't plan on buying more than 1 board, so ideally I'm after a snowboard that is quite versatile but suits/leans more towards my style of riding. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last year, I asked a staff member at the rental shop what type of board would be right for me given that I want 1 board that is as versatile as possible to which he replied: ""Probably get yourself a soft camber"". I am not entirely sure what this means in terms of specific detail when I'm looking online at snowboards. 

&amp;#x200B;

Below is a bit of a profile about myself: 

\- Weight: 81 KG / 179LB

\- Height: 175CM / 5'7

&amp;#x200B;

More/other information: 

\- I guess I'm after something that is all-mountain, but also leaning towards freestyle riding (through park, jumps and eventually rails). 

\- I want something with a bit of flex as I'd be into buttering and ollie-ing around.

What type of camber profile/flex/height/other things should I be aiming towards?

A newbie can’t seem to figure out if i’m regular or goofy,"Hi everyone,

As the title states i’m a newbie, ive snowboarded for a total of 4 or 5 days over the span of 3 years. But recently went and bought my first pair of boots to get more serious about it. Prior to that last year i went to perisher in Australia and took lesson but i was very unsure about regular or goofy. 

Ive done the 3 or 4 test methods to find out. If i slide on a smooth surface with socks on, i put my right (dominant) leg front for stability. If i get someone to push me i put right leg down first. If i climb stairs i always put right leg first. However some articles indicate different style for each of those methods. For example the socks one indicates goofy if you put right leg first whereas the the stairs one indicates regular if i put my right leg first. So i’m very confused as i will be renting the board this year for my trip and am unsure what to tell them on how to set it up. Ive tried to visualise while standing and both seem pretty natural to me. 

I want to spend less time figuring basic things i should have figured out by now and more time learning. Anyone got any tips?

I like wide for rails and boxes but it interferes with jumps and spins. I like narrow for jumps and spins but it interferes with rails and boxes. Seems like I have to 'sacrifice' somewhere in my stance when everyone else seems to have found their perfect stance width. 

I have seen some pretty insane stance widths. 6' guys with a very narrow stance and on the other spectrum, 5'5""-5'6"" guys with a very wide stance. Doesn't seem to fit the motto of go with 'shoulder width'. 

Seb Toots is one of my favorite riders since he is about my height and size. He is 5'6"" and rides a very wide stance. Wider than usual for a guy that is 5'6"". I don't know his actual stance width number but from just looking at his stance...I can tell it is 'very' wide...probably 24"" or larger. 

In general...I just stick to 22"". But...I seem to always change it larger or smaller thru out the day depending on the feature or terrain. Seems like I can't make up my mind and I hate having to change my stance width multiple times thru out the day. 

Should I start riding 2 different setups...? One for rails/boxes and one for jumps...? That way I don't have to end up fiddling around with my stance width thru out the day.",snowboarding,1561534495,Tiger_Bite_Kid,True,2019-06-26,0
Going from rocker to camber... Will I regret it?,"hey guys! I need advice with regards to my next snowboard :)

I generally snowboard in Japan/Canada, only 3-4 weeks a season (and 1-2 weeks in NZ/Australia sometimes). I've been doing it for 6 years, so I'm not that great - I enjoy medium-dense tree runs in the side country of japan/canada resorts the most, especially the powder days. I spend a lot of time on the groomed runs with my partner as well if she is around.

I have been riding Burton custom flying V I got 6 years ago, which is rocker in the middle and camber under the boots. I have to stick with burton as I got the step-on boots last season which I did quite like!

I've been looking at the freeride snowboards with directional camber - Burton flight attendant, Burton deep thinker. But these are camber middle, with a rocker at the nose.

Am I hurting myself by changing from 6 years of rocker to camber, or for what I do, will it actually benefit me more / make my riding more enjoyable? I'm mostly worried that I'll waste a season trying to re-adjust to the board! I'm also curious how the directional cambers will affect riding in Australia where it's a bit more.. icy.

Any input would be really appreciated, and also if anyone has those boards, any feedback would be appreciated (the flight attendant seem to have lots of fans, but I couldn't find much love for deep thinker).",snowboarding,1561537358,Slothicious,True,2019-06-26,0

Developing a snowboard game and need help with some trick names,"Hi, I’m currently trying to name some snowboard tricks based on different rotations in a mobile game I’m developing (grand mountain adventure), and have some questions I hope some of you can help me with. The tricks are a bit odd perhaps but they are possible to make in the game so it would be nice to give them a semi-accurate name.

Important note:
I’ve researched a lot around the internet but haven’t found any good answers hence this post. While researching this I’ve also noticed it’s a VERY infected topic sometimes. So let’s keep any discussions constructive, it’s a game so I have no ambition to get it perfectly accurate :)


Q1: When doing a full barrel roll+180 spin the resulting trick is a 540 rodeo (looks identical compared to clips). If I double this rotation (2 barrel rolls+360 spin) I guess that could be a double rodeo 720, but I’ve never heard of that trick, only dbl rodeo 900. Does the dbl rodeo 7 exist, is it impossible, or does it have another name?

Q2: combining a half backflip and a half roll you would land on your board again, again I’ve never seen this trick but does it have a name or is it impossible?

Q3: would it make sense to name a backwards barrel roll “Bs Barrel” and forwards to Fs Barrel or is there some other naming for this?",snowboarding,1561628373,girgo,True,2019-06-27,0

Salomon Boots Experiences/Reviews...???,"Need some info on Salomon boots. 

1. Which is softer...The Dialogue or The Hi Fi...? Is the difference in flex between the two minimal or pretty discernible...?
2. Does Salomon boots use a inner lace system that is attached to the liner or attached to the back of the boot's inner...? I like inner lace systems that are attached to the boots inner like what Nike had with their boots when they were in snowboarding. I feel like it pulls your foot even further back into the heel pocket and helps eliminate heel lift. I have somewhat 'small'/low heels and the Nike style inner lace system helped the most with heel lift. 
3. Do Salomon boots have a thick or thin midsole...? I like boots that have a thick midsole. Being older...I need a lot of cushioning for impacts and just overall comfort for aging/aching joints and muscles. Nike and Adidas were the only ones I found to have the most cushioning. I hate boots that have a very thin/minimal midsole like what 32 boots has. From pictures and photos online...it seems like Salomon is somewhere in the middle between thin and thick in regards to their midsole thickness. 
4. What's the overall comfort/fit and finish level like with Salomon boots...? Durability...? Versatility/features for customization...? 
5. On average do Salomon boots feel tall, medium or short in regards to their Upper's height...? I am 5'6""-5'7"" but I have somewhat short shins. Therefore I like boots that don't feel high on my shin. I like them to feel medium or somewhat short because I feel like I get more freedom of movement and it doesn't feel so 'restricting'.

I am planning on purchasing [Small sports equipment](https://www.icelandair.com/support/baggage/allowance/) for my snowboard. The guidelines say:

* Snowboard equipment may consist of one snowboard and one pair of boots.
* Clothing is not allowed in the bag. 

I have a snowboard bag and pack my board, boots, helmet, goggles, and snowboard clothing in it.

It seems silly to not allow clothing or additional snowboard-related gear to be packed in the bag. Has anyone had experience with this?

Is IcelandAir really this strict with not allowing clothing to be packed in the bag with the snowboard?",snowboarding,1560870750,ahaskins5,True,2019-06-18,0
LF Opinions on a couple resorts,"Trying to choose between a few different resorts for next year. I’m from the east coast and have been to park city and vail as well as almost every resort in VT/NH. I think we’re going to end up with a 6-8 person crew so may rent a good size Airbnb. 

The options I’m looking at-
Jackson Hole
Whistler
Breck
Steamboat
Vail (again, but staying in walk to lift dist instead of staying in Avon)

The factors in weighing are-
Cost / flight time (CO wins there bc of the cheap direct flights to Denver) 

Probability of snow, we got skunked last year in park city with hard pack for a week

Size of Mtn and terrain quality

Nightlife, we have fun. CO gets another little bump with legal weed, though flying with stuff is damn near legal now anyway so it’s not a huge deal. 

Any input is definitely appropriated !",snowboarding,1560875820,Threexo,True,2019-06-18,0

Jones Ultra Mountain Twin vs Capita Kazu Pro,"I'm heading out to Japan next season, which obviously means a tonne of pow riding. And I'm thinking that my 2017 T Rice Pro is an absolute quiver killer, it's a bit on the shorter side for riding Japow, especially for a true twin board. I also prefer the progressive flex of a true camber board as opposed to hybrid or rocker.

My goal is to eventually have a park board, and an all mountain/freeride charger, but i won't be in the spot to afford both for a bit of time. So I'm trying to decide between these two boards as a freeride board which will still perform in the park.

The Jones is STIFF so I won't be doing many butter tricks (not that I'd have much time for them in Japan) but has more of a twin shape for a directional board. So I trade off the playfulness for better switch riding, pop, and stability. And I do enjoy a butter.

The Kazu is softer but still on the responsive side of mid flex, but it has a more directional shape with a tapered tail and directional rocker profile. So trade off pop, stability, and switch riding potential (though it still rides very well switch) for a more playful board.

I'm leaning more towards the Jones because it seems more of a pow charger with a lot of freestyle potential. And because Sammy Luebke And I'll eventually pick up something more for the park like a DOA or a Headspace. But the Kazu still seems to have potential that I might miss out on.

Sacrificing highback rotation for less toe overhang?,"The Union Falcor is a killer binding! However it does have one glaring drawback. You can’t adjust the highback rotation and heel cup individually like you can with a lot of other Union bindings. 

My boots are on the larger side for the binding, so if I want the highback parallel with my edge my toes end up hanging over the edge a fair bit more.

I run a fair amount of forward lean. I’ll be in japan next season so I’ll be spending most of my time in the deep stuff.

Ribcap compared to helmet,"Hi people.

I received a protective ribcap beanie for Christmas, and used it for a good bit of the winter. Mostly on days where I knew I wouldn’t be doing anything crazy.

I haven’t wrecked with it yet, and am curious about what I have here.

Helmet Fixes? Or just Different Head Shape?,"Hello, before I start, I reside in a tropical country so I can't just go into a snowsports store to try on helmets. Snowsports stores don't exist here.

I finally decided to buy a snowboard helmet online, specifically the Salomon Quest Helmet. I measured my head circumference to be 54cm and the Quest specifies small to be in the range of 53-56cm. On the website, it states that it is an oval helmet. Having never tried any snowboard helmets before, I thought, ""heads are oval aren't they? This should fit fine"".

Upon finally receiving and trying on the helmet, I found that there were pressure points on both my temples and it felt like the helmet was crushing my head from the sides or ready to pop back off the top of my head. I removed the liner and it became too loose.

Would it be advised to try compressing/sanding the foam on the temples area? The helmet fits very snuggly with the exception of those two points and I really think that compressing it by about 2mm is going to help a ton. Otherwise, if anyone can share their experience with different helmet brands and their helmet shapes, I think it'd help me a lot if I end up having to buy a different one. Right now I don't really know what my head shape is because when I look in the mirror, it's just oval and I don't have any other experience to compare it to.

Also, I don't know how to use the air fit system, what's shown on the manual is completely different from the helmet! All I see is a small metal button.",snowboarding,1560517890,DracoRiff,True,2019-06-14,0

Mammoth for a month?,"This was my first season snowboarding in Colorado and I fell in love.

Is the trip going to be worth it? Will good snowboarding conditions last that long? \[I know it's summer and I won't be getting that fresh deep powder like I did in the winter here in Colorado, just don't want to get out there and end up with a patch of snow\]

Are there (free?) places nearby Mammoth where I could move around and set up my roof-top tent every night? 

Is there a place around Mammoth (even like a starbucks) where I could spend some time each day studying for the GRE and other things with wifi?

I've been busting gnarly throwback mcshuffles, squidbison troubleshooters, cuddlepond swimmytickles, and all kinds of other moves. But nothing tops my best story.

I was in the alps, spinning a quickshot chickenflick, heading down the biggest ramp on the black diamond. I heard my girl telling me to do the marriage proposal mctwist. So I was screaming down the hill to the ramp, I got on one knee and I stuck the landing. Right after I stuck the landing, I knew God was real, because I had a vision and saw Jesus Christ saying ""sick, bro, automatic heaven entry right there."" I can't believe I was saved in that moment.

Beginner Board Flex Recommendations &amp; Theories...???,"I am a little confused. Most people would agree and recommend a board that is more 'softer' flexing for a beginner. But...Doesn't it make more 'sense' to have a beginner start with a board that is more 'stiffer' flexing versus softer. 

I have been thinking about board flex's and what kinds of snowboards shop workers usually recommend for a beginner. 

A lot of seasoned/experienced snowboarders will tell a beginner to start with a soft flexing board. My theory is I believe a beginner should actually start with a stiff flexing board. Reason is...

A. A beginner is not going to be making FULL ON 'S' turns or pin point straight-line edge carves on their first day. Most likely...they will be 'side slipping' with their heels on a bunny slope that is really flat. 

B. A beginner's legs, ankles and feet are not that strong and have not yet learned how to 'flex' a board properly. 

Therefore...wouldn't it make more sense for a beginner to start on a board that is stiff so that it can 'support' a beginner's weak legs/ankles and form/technique while side slipping on soft snow...? Or do I have it all wrong and a beginner should start on a soft flexing board...?",snowboarding,1559430065,Tiger_Bite_Kid,True,2019-06-01,0

Tips for a,"Hey all! I’m a skier and have absolutely been welcomed into the dark side. With the Southern Hemisphere season coming up I am absolutely planning to get into lessons and begin taking up (the cooler) side of winter sports. I know in its infancy and understand it takes awhile to figure it out but hear me out.

If I skateboard, I am goofy. However I would kick with my right foot. (Left back, right forward) when I jumped on a board it completely threw me as I am very right dominant but left forward seemed so unnatural. Getting off the chair lift I would eat shit every time I clipped in on my left leg, but right forward I would be fine.

Anyone else faced this? Does anyone ever stay duck footed or is this something I’ll favour one side eveeeentually. Just making learning that much harder. The whole push yourself and see what foot goes forward doesn’t help haha

Advice: Conditioning leather mitts?,"Hey everyone, 

Just looking to get a bit advice with leather mitts. For reference, it's this pair: https://www.dakine.com/en-ca/sport/snow/gloves-mitts/team-fleetwood-mitt-womens/

Only part of the back side (top half) and the palm is leather, though - everything else is more of you typical glove/fabric material. 

There are a few things I was hoping to get some info on: 

- What's the best way to condition or waterproof them? I figured getting some kind of leather conditioner/wax would be sufficient and just rub it on. The glove is goat leather so I don't really know if there's anything I should be wary of. 

- I have read that some people will actually ""bake"" their gloves in the oven (low heat) for better/deeper conditioner absorbance. Has anyone done this? I don't think I would in my case (don't know how it would affect the glove overall and I think I would melt off all the plastic straps...lol) but I'm mostly curious. Or I imagine maybe using a blow dryer on low heat in selected areas would be better. 

- Any suggestions on actual conditioners? For the most part I see Nikwax suggested. Curious to know if you guys know of any other options. I'm not super concerned with deepening of any colors either. 

- Any other suggestions with general maintenance? For the most part it seems fairly straight forward but I appreciate any info.
